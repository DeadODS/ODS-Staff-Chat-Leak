2017-09-05 18:59:37.357000 - Spencer: But with the walls made by Brady and the buildings made by baru the difference could be conflicting
2017-09-05 18:59:16.997000 - Spencer: I know baru does textures
2017-09-05 18:59:10.213000 - Spencer: What's the plan with the textures we need

2017-09-03 20:23:09.446000 - reynn: i had to postpone the logo
2017-09-03 20:23:09.050000 - Stormish: politibots on ods
2017-09-03 20:23:03.122000 - reynn: so

2017-09-03 20:22:19.728000 - Kyle: Which is why i'm confused that baru came out of nowhere with TTR
2017-09-03 20:22:08.284000 - Stormish: they said they did it to "put other players into it"
2017-09-03 20:22:05.149000 - Kyle: Yeah
2017-09-03 20:21:59.722000 - Stormish: especially because of them putting the game on greenlight
2017-09-03 20:21:39.797000 - Stormish: altis would definitely do anything to beat ttr i'm betting
2017-09-03 20:21:27.285000 - Stormish: we are not altis
2017-09-03 20:19:58.407000 - reynn: i'm saying there's no rush
2017-09-03 20:19:48.457000 - reynn: can you like not?
2017-09-03 20:19:38.461000 - reynn: dude
2017-09-03 20:19:29.329000 - Kyle: m8 I asked how far along we are not "Release now beat TTR"
2017-09-03 20:19:24.743000 - reynn: if i was working on something i'd hate if it was overshadowed like that
2017-09-03 20:19:05.188000 - reynn: it's gonna die down soon anyways but
2017-09-03 20:18:55.469000 - reynn: with the species
2017-09-03 20:18:52.341000 - reynn: and not when there's a hype about ttr
2017-09-03 20:18:44.252000 - reynn: yeah but when people work on stuff we might as well wait to have people actually excited for it
2017-09-03 20:18:21.403000 - Kyle: We don't do it just for population
2017-09-03 20:18:13.345000 - Kyle: Ok???
2017-09-03 20:18:02.449000 - reynn: speaking about population
2017-09-03 20:17:58.998000 - Kyle: That's not what I asked?
2017-09-03 20:17:52.444000 - Kyle: Wha
2017-09-03 20:17:48.284000 - Kyle: We should all be up to date
2017-09-03 20:17:44.592000 - reynn: it's not like we can beat ttr
2017-09-03 20:17:26.335000 - SlimShadyIAm: Y
2017-09-03 20:16:37.483000 - Kyle: @everyone

2017-09-03 18:58:14.184000 - Kyle: Check the chat logs to see who did what
2017-09-03 18:58:05.957000 - Kyle: Get the toon ID's (But you probably meant that so no worries there) of both toons
2017-09-03 18:57:48.690000 - Kyle: You first

2017-09-03 17:23:07.367000 - Kyle: Nah I just can't change roles from right clicking the player name in ods
2017-09-03 17:22:08.969000 - Prof McMouse: Only people below that role
2017-09-03 17:22:01.467000 - Prof McMouse: You can't change someone with the same role of you
2017-09-03 17:20:06.174000 - Kyle: Also I can't change roles?
2017-09-03 17:17:37.994000 - Kyle: <@175594692237328384> are Rare/Alex going to stay as mods on the O:DS discord but not here? I thought they were leaving entirely

2017-09-03 11:27:28.647000 - reynn: it would be better to keep rebranding for some big update
2017-09-03 11:27:14.433000 - reynn: i feel like i might have to postpone the logo finalizing until the last week of september but i don't think it even matters because like

2017-09-03 11:25:26.070000 - AbsentHiya: he doesnt do the textures
2017-09-03 11:25:18.525000 - AbsentHiya: <@!139483077079597056> you can go to triangles u know
2017-09-03 11:21:37.924000 - reynn: he said he will finish all of his assignments

2017-09-03 11:21:05.947000 - Spencer: The biggest textures are the DG buildings
2017-09-03 11:20:42.106000 - Spencer: Yeah
2017-09-03 11:20:18.456000 - reynn: <@200018553653428225> <@!190864079634694144> so basically i'm the main texture artist since brady left? it just sucks because brady kinda led the direction but i guess we can do it together too just fine
2017-09-03 11:18:28.336000 - reynn: there's no shame in using references

2017-09-03 11:14:36.010000 - qloo: brady was teaching me to do texturing iirc so i could help with texturing

2017-09-02 06:07:43.921000 - Disyer: so its more of a problem
2017-09-02 06:07:33.882000 - Disyer: but players get direct advantages ingame for that game

2017-08-31 01:44:24.131000 - brady: doesnt matter
2017-08-31 01:44:20.178000 - brady: suitx then
2017-08-31 01:44:09.196000 - Spencer: SuitD is the name of his feminine thin cog body
2017-08-31 01:42:04.626000 - brady: and try to get the animations in
2017-08-31 01:41:53.796000 - brady: stormish could make a suitd especially for this
2017-08-31 01:41:31.694000 - Spencer: Yeah the skinny suit has the stomp, maybe we could make a suit type that uses suit b animations but has broader shoulders
2017-08-31 01:40:50.783000 - brady: yea
2017-08-31 01:40:47.350000 - Spencer: Suit c is fat, suit a is muscular, suit b is skinny
2017-08-31 01:40:47.284000 - brady: cuz the tall one has the stomp
2017-08-31 01:40:31.795000 - brady: the tall one or is that c
2017-08-31 01:40:17.020000 - brady: maybe suit b
2017-08-31 01:40:12.262000 - brady: hm
2017-08-31 01:40:00.478000 - brady: yeah
2017-08-31 01:39:52.061000 - Spencer: As a special body that used suita animations
2017-08-31 01:39:35.834000 - Spencer: That could be arranged
2017-08-31 01:39:24.037000 - brady: pants could work too
2017-08-31 01:39:19.458000 - brady: but with a skelecog head
2017-08-31 01:39:13.429000 - brady: we should use that for this
2017-08-31 01:39:05.302000 - brady: i just like the exposed interior
2017-08-31 01:38:53.272000 - Spencer: Good shit
2017-08-31 01:38:48.054000 - Spencer: I loved these when you drew them
2017-08-31 01:38:39.628000 - brady:
2017-08-31 01:38:38.717000 - Spencer: Too bad the skelecog models break when exported
2017-08-31 01:38:01.134000 - brady: like the mr hollywood concept but no pants
2017-08-31 01:37:47.123000 - brady: i kinda want the skelecog to wear a blazer
2017-08-31 01:37:32.699000 - SpectrumW: Ah, if I haven't been off the computer due to an ear ache, I could sketch a concept.
2017-08-31 01:37:03.884000 - brady: would probably be a skelecog but i think we should make a new modified skelecog
2017-08-31 01:36:18.519000 - brady: so like 6
2017-08-31 01:36:13.354000 - brady: we would need a special cog like this for every department
2017-08-31 01:35:42.214000 - SpectrumW: It would depend on what the cog would be or look like.
2017-08-31 01:35:32.766000 - brady: or both
2017-08-31 01:35:28.203000 - brady: or a mover and shaker stomp
2017-08-31 01:35:04.186000 - Spencer: It could do a vp style jump yeah
2017-08-31 01:33:10.531000 - brady: there would be attacks such as like rockets the cog would shoot out of his back or something that would attack other toons in the area outside the battle
2017-08-31 01:29:09.959000 - brady: not too big
2017-08-31 01:29:01.572000 - brady: the cog would also be pretty big
2017-08-31 01:28:52.240000 - brady: it would be our version of the director of ambush marketing thing
2017-08-31 01:28:36.424000 - brady: yeah
2017-08-31 01:28:28.224000 - SpectrumW: Sort of like a "world" boss.  Looks like it would be nice. Add gag immunity rounds and you could get something interesting.
2017-08-31 01:25:55.984000 - brady: then it goes on until its dead
2017-08-31 01:25:45.879000 - brady: where 8 more toons can fight it
2017-08-31 01:25:36.230000 - brady: and goes to another cell
2017-08-31 01:25:22.425000 - brady: then the cog attacks and does some random stuff for a while
2017-08-31 01:25:07.166000 - brady: after the cog looses 1/4 of its health the round is over and the toons are unbounded to the cell
2017-08-31 01:24:18.123000 - brady: but the cog has a ton of health
2017-08-31 01:24:10.774000 - brady: and the cog attacks everyone one side at a time
2017-08-31 01:23:44.628000 - brady: and the timer would wait for the other side
2017-08-31 01:23:34.808000 - brady: each set of 4 would choose gags and attack at the same time
2017-08-31 01:23:05.760000 - brady: with turns and shit
2017-08-31 01:23:01.557000 - brady: basically it would work like a normal battle inside the battle for toons
2017-08-31 01:15:44.757000 - Spencer: yeah, something like that would be great for playground events and shit
2017-08-31 01:12:58.351000 - brady: 4 on each side
2017-08-31 01:12:53.578000 - brady: one cog vs 8
2017-08-31 01:12:48.639000 - brady: but like
2017-08-31 01:12:47.055000 - brady: same toon interface and shit
2017-08-31 01:12:36.351000 - brady: one that would accommodate a new type of battle
2017-08-31 01:12:23.005000 - brady: would it be possible to make a new kind of battle cell
2017-08-31 01:12:13.876000 - brady: hey disyer
2017-08-31 00:53:35.543000 - Spencer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqkHmDNPLDg
2017-08-31 00:50:21.076000 - Disyer: true
2017-08-31 00:50:15.307000 - Spencer: What if you're like right next to a wall when the cog runs into you
2017-08-31 00:50:15.033000 - Disyer: i guess thats why battle cells might be needed
2017-08-31 00:50:10.791000 - Disyer: just need a way to stop battles from overlapping with each other i guess
2017-08-31 00:50:03.529000 - SpectrumW: https://youtu.be/UH67fnZQ8dY?t=8m37s
2017-08-31 00:49:59.536000 - Disyer: we can place battles  anywhere
2017-08-31 00:49:56.421000 - Disyer: we dont even need battle cells
2017-08-31 00:47:03.056000 - Spencer: Also it could be weird regarding battle cells
2017-08-31 00:46:21.481000 - Spencer: Where would they even show up
2017-08-31 00:43:49.192000 - Spencer: Ok tti
2017-08-31 00:43:39.210000 - Triangle (Andrew) Vance: yes
2017-08-31 00:43:36.089000 - Triangle (Andrew) Vance: i was thinking camera goons. spot light that chases you. once it hits, a cog spawns right thbere and chases you. once it gets you fight starts
2017-08-31 00:42:51.255000 - Spencer: Etc
2017-08-31 00:42:48.776000 - Spencer: Or goons
2017-08-31 00:42:46.490000 - Spencer: Or cogs dropping in
2017-08-31 00:42:40.625000 - Spencer: Could be lasers and shit like in server rooms
2017-08-31 00:42:28.721000 - qloo: what abt obstacles and stuff
2017-08-31 00:42:24.920000 - brady: or do we scrap the chase
2017-08-31 00:42:17.711000 - brady: eh
2017-08-31 00:42:16.525000 - Spencer: Or easier I should say
2017-08-31 00:42:05.924000 - Spencer: If you take the chase route you could make it like a bunch of randomly generated segments in a row plus I imagine it would be easy to code
2017-08-31 00:41:37.865000 - AbsentHiya: ill be around if u guys need anything ok
2017-08-31 00:41:27.242000 - qloo: ``yes``
2017-08-31 00:41:26.282000 - AbsentHiya: yes
2017-08-31 00:41:22.038000 - brady: is this a crossover episode?
2017-08-31 00:41:17.975000 - Spencer: Lmao
2017-08-31 00:41:12.621000 - qloo: dude vp and cio crossover ???????????
2017-08-31 00:41:11.472000 - AbsentHiya: the CFO and CEO
2017-08-31 00:41:08.541000 - AbsentHiya: similar to like
2017-08-31 00:41:05.784000 - AbsentHiya: i'd want a bit more interactability
2017-08-31 00:40:48.140000 - brady: gg
2017-08-31 00:40:46.177000 - AbsentHiya: LOL
2017-08-31 00:40:44.374000 - brady: lmao
2017-08-31 00:40:42.673000 - Spencer: Fuck
2017-08-31 00:40:40.962000 - Spencer: Sorry I meant cio
2017-08-31 00:40:38.093000 - AbsentHiya: vp??
2017-08-31 00:40:35.818000 - Spencer: Or something
2017-08-31 00:40:34.530000 - brady: vp?
2017-08-31 00:40:31.129000 - Spencer: Before that is two cog rounds
2017-08-31 00:40:22.886000 - Spencer: Listen the vp chases you and all that and then at the very end all the toons pass like a quicksand pit and the cio falls in
2017-08-31 00:40:03.014000 - AbsentHiya: 1 sec
2017-08-31 00:40:02.390000 - brady: its just annoying to have this lemon feature
2017-08-31 00:40:00.133000 - AbsentHiya: ill mute it here
2017-08-31 00:39:53.905000 - brady: can we get rid of this bot
2017-08-31 00:39:46.427000 - brady: no trap door
2017-08-31 00:39:44.549000 - Spencer: I think the cio chasing you down would be great
2017-08-31 00:39:39.348000 - AbsentHiya: ok can we go back to the sound and trap door or nah
2017-08-31 00:39:26.641000 - brady: we put that aside
2017-08-31 00:39:21.931000 - brady: ok
2017-08-31 00:39:21.360000 - Spencer: As a field office it works better
2017-08-31 00:39:14.721000 - Spencer: I like that
2017-08-31 00:39:08.667000 - Spencer: Yes
2017-08-31 00:39:07.930000 - AbsentHiya: pls no
2017-08-31 00:39:05.895000 - brady: for software simian
2017-08-31 00:39:03.368000 - AbsentHiya: ^
2017-08-31 00:39:01.452000 - brady: actually this would be better as a techbot field office
2017-08-31 00:38:56.410000 - Spencer: Brady 2d vine game is already bad enough
2017-08-31 00:38:43.023000 - brady: and theres wires as vines
2017-08-31 00:38:37.530000 - AbsentHiya: 40 is the amount that is taken when you fall into the water in server rooms
2017-08-31 00:38:34.920000 - brady: so its like a 3d jungle vine game
2017-08-31 00:38:27.172000 - Spencer: Imo
2017-08-31 00:38:22.194000 - Spencer: Uh lmao 50 isn't too high
2017-08-31 00:38:19.825000 - brady: good idea incoming
2017-08-31 00:38:16.257000 - brady: woah
2017-08-31 00:38:15.056000 - AbsentHiya: do 40
2017-08-31 00:38:14.030000 - AbsentHiya: 50 is too high
2017-08-31 00:38:13.214000 - qloo: i like the idea of a chase scene, but i'd hope that it wouldnt make the battle stand out too much from the rest of the boss battles
2017-08-31 00:38:04.833000 - Spencer: How about it would hurt you by like 50 and push your toon forward
2017-08-31 00:38:01.172000 - AbsentHiya: well they'd have to be decently easy to avoid <@191661929905913856>
2017-08-31 00:37:53.708000 - SpectrumW: Suddenly I remember the one mammoth boss fight from Mario & Luigi: Dream Team
2017-08-31 00:37:39.177000 - AbsentHiya: nah jk
2017-08-31 00:37:37.859000 - AbsentHiya: *permanently*
2017-08-31 00:37:36.039000 - brady: i mean
2017-08-31 00:37:33.939000 - brady: or
2017-08-31 00:37:27.543000 - Spencer: Uh ok
2017-08-31 00:37:21.862000 - brady: you die
2017-08-31 00:37:21.285000 - Spencer: Do you just spawn again
2017-08-31 00:37:18.171000 - brady: and server towers are falling over
2017-08-31 00:37:16.295000 - Spencer: The problem is what happens if you get run over
2017-08-31 00:37:05.981000 - Spencer: Yes I've always wanted that
2017-08-31 00:37:04.823000 - AbsentHiya: eg. if you have 1 toon doing 1 foghorn, the CIO moves away slower
2017-08-31 00:37:03.962000 - brady: and the cio is chasing you
2017-08-31 00:36:55.950000 - brady: like running through an alley
2017-08-31 00:36:50.206000 - AbsentHiya: but the more toons means more speed
2017-08-31 00:36:46.931000 - brady: a chase scene would be cool
2017-08-31 00:36:45.475000 - AbsentHiya: ok, only 1 toon at a time is needed
2017-08-31 00:36:35.901000 - Spencer: Also that
2017-08-31 00:36:34.853000 - AbsentHiya: shit
2017-08-31 00:36:30.110000 - AbsentHiya: if the trap door is added;
2017-08-31 00:36:29.827000 - Disyer: what about solos
2017-08-31 00:36:25.579000 - Spencer: It would be too easy just nonstop attacking them with sound
2017-08-31 00:36:12.868000 - Spencer: Wouldn't they try to move back to attack you at some point
2017-08-31 00:35:54.127000 - AbsentHiya: to make any progress
2017-08-31 00:35:50.221000 - AbsentHiya: using the sound gag
2017-08-31 00:35:44.890000 - AbsentHiya: facing the CIO
2017-08-31 00:35:39.706000 - Spencer: Also I generally say they even when I can say she just because
2017-08-31 00:35:39.296000 - AbsentHiya: 3 toons at once
2017-08-31 00:35:35.843000 - AbsentHiya: you should need like
2017-08-31 00:35:22.042000 - Spencer: It would be difficult to push them
2017-08-31 00:35:15.072000 - AbsentHiya: she'd
2017-08-31 00:35:10.768000 - AbsentHiya: yeah that's how she's be directed
2017-08-31 00:34:58.536000 - Spencer: Yeah they would wanna avoid the sound
2017-08-31 00:34:50.695000 - brady: the cio isnt blind
2017-08-31 00:34:46.987000 - brady: the sound should hurt
2017-08-31 00:34:42.967000 - brady: doesnt make sense to direct the boss
2017-08-31 00:34:36.361000 - AbsentHiya: to kind of control the cio
2017-08-31 00:34:27.483000 - AbsentHiya: like spectrum said
2017-08-31 00:34:14.548000 - brady: just how do we utilize them
2017-08-31 00:34:07.743000 - brady: not a bad idea
2017-08-31 00:34:04.584000 - brady: idk i like the use of sound gags
2017-08-31 00:33:46.299000 - AbsentHiya: what would u change
2017-08-31 00:33:39.059000 - brady: idk
2017-08-31 00:33:06.675000 - brady: eh
2017-08-31 00:32:22.536000 - Spencer: Meh
2017-08-31 00:30:29.385000 - AbsentHiya: but does 20+ damage and damages her for 50 or more
2017-08-31 00:30:26.858000 - AbsentHiya: it replicates the VP/CJ jumping
2017-08-31 00:30:20.758000 - AbsentHiya: when she hits the ground
2017-08-31 00:30:17.523000 - AbsentHiya: when she goes thru, she drops from the roof
2017-08-31 00:30:08.785000 - AbsentHiya: you use sound to lead the cio to a really big trap door
2017-08-31 00:30:00.317000 - AbsentHiya: ooh, here's an idea
2017-08-31 00:29:53.088000 - Spencer: I had this idea where it was like the CEO battle where she chases you but there's no tables and you have to trick her into running over banana peels and such
2017-08-31 00:29:45.709000 - AbsentHiya: what could that trap be
2017-08-31 00:29:35.945000 - SpectrumW: Exactly!
2017-08-31 00:29:28.370000 - AbsentHiya: into a trap
2017-08-31 00:29:17.945000 - SpectrumW: Or perhaps using sound to direct the boss or something.
2017-08-31 00:29:10.878000 - AbsentHiya: or whatever i put in
2017-08-31 00:29:08.135000 - AbsentHiya: rather than throwing electronics
2017-08-31 00:28:58.885000 - AbsentHiya: you could use foghorn to stun
2017-08-31 00:28:52.608000 - Spencer: Sound would need to be more visual to work in a battle, like visible sound waves and such
2017-08-31 00:28:50.097000 - AbsentHiya: hmm
2017-08-31 00:28:37.863000 - AbsentHiya: i mean
2017-08-31 00:28:26.456000 - AbsentHiya: it's a different train
2017-08-31 00:28:23.960000 - SpectrumW: Could be sound or/and tu... but how to put those in...
2017-08-31 00:28:23.033000 - AbsentHiya: was just joke tho
2017-08-31 00:28:19.451000 - AbsentHiya: true
2017-08-31 00:28:03.286000 - Spencer: Cbhq came out before level seven gags
2017-08-31 00:27:31.875000 - Spencer: Barely
2017-08-31 00:27:25.756000 - AbsentHiya: üòâ
2017-08-31 00:27:24.151000 - AbsentHiya: train
2017-08-31 00:27:22.765000 - AbsentHiya: cfo
2017-08-31 00:27:21.674000 - AbsentHiya: spencer
2017-08-31 00:27:16.544000 - brady: thats not what i said at all
2017-08-31 00:27:11.194000 - Spencer: Still no bosses using trap gags
2017-08-31 00:26:48.226000 - AbsentHiya: that's like saying pies are too common because they're in vp and also a gag
2017-08-31 00:26:31.082000 - brady: still
2017-08-31 00:26:29.436000 - brady: but magnets
2017-08-31 00:26:21.562000 - AbsentHiya: to pull
2017-08-31 00:26:20.493000 - AbsentHiya: use magnets
2017-08-31 00:26:18.929000 - AbsentHiya: i mean
2017-08-31 00:26:16.973000 - AbsentHiya: brady nowhere in the game do you pull magnets out of the undercarriage of a cog boss
2017-08-31 00:26:02.666000 - AbsentHiya: huh
2017-08-31 00:26:02.355000 - brady: im not saying its bad
2017-08-31 00:25:51.306000 - AbsentHiya: >:(
2017-08-31 00:25:50.675000 - brady: its just not original
2017-08-31 00:25:39.926000 - brady: i think we should come up with something other than magnets
2017-08-31 00:25:32.694000 - AbsentHiya: true
2017-08-31 00:24:36.731000 - Spencer: Yeah many portions of the cio concept are still up in the air
2017-08-31 00:19:52.337000 - Frank: yeah that's true
2017-08-31 00:19:45.805000 - Disyer: and besides it wouldnt make sense to write code before we actually know how it'd work
2017-08-31 00:19:31.284000 - Disyer: it'd take more time to copy paste the code to work with ods than just to write it from scratch
2017-08-31 00:19:18.230000 - Disyer: u cant just jump into stride source lmao
2017-08-31 00:19:08.401000 - Frank: ?
2017-08-31 00:18:50.447000 - Disyer: thats not how it works
2017-08-31 00:18:48.574000 - Disyer: um no
2017-08-31 00:15:54.928000 - AbsentHiya: maybe the VP as a filler
2017-08-31 00:15:51.148000 - Frank: true
2017-08-31 00:15:43.828000 - AbsentHiya: all you'd need is the room and a model to work with
2017-08-31 00:15:35.299000 - AbsentHiya: stride source?
2017-08-31 00:15:31.727000 - AbsentHiya: can't it just be done with like
2017-08-31 00:15:13.376000 - Frank: i'd like to do that, but i don't have access to the game code xd
2017-08-31 00:14:59.635000 - Frank: i do
2017-08-31 00:14:49.663000 - AbsentHiya: ok look man you told me you wanted to program something
2017-08-31 00:14:37.977000 - Frank: xd
2017-08-31 00:14:37.171000 - Frank: i don't have access to the code of this game
2017-08-31 00:14:28.522000 - AbsentHiya: lemme look t the concept again
2017-08-31 00:14:21.100000 - AbsentHiya: (that will remove health)

2017-08-27 14:12:43.669000 - SlimShadyIAm: Mute is just add the mute role to them
2017-08-27 14:12:40.237000 - reynn: i didn't wanna ban them either
2017-08-27 14:12:31.862000 - SlimShadyIAm: You don't have the ban permission?

2017-08-27 14:11:31.228000 - reynn: why should an artist act as a moderator
2017-08-27 14:11:11.184000 - SlimShadyIAm: Yeah it's been that way for a few months kek

2017-08-27 14:10:45.359000 - SlimShadyIAm: I think Alex is just grinding on ttr
2017-08-27 14:10:20.064000 - SlimShadyIAm: Alex is British
2017-08-27 14:10:04.295000 - reynn: so preferably would be better to get someone european/british
2017-08-27 14:09:54.080000 - reynn: and kyle is only online during his own daytime hours

2017-08-27 14:07:05.597000 - reynn: especially since <@136254457640910849> is online but doesn't even respond
2017-08-27 14:06:49.649000 - reynn: we definitely should
2017-08-27 14:06:41.202000 - SlimShadyIAm: We have 3 mods and 2 of them are inactive, should we do something about that?
2017-08-27 14:05:50.102000 - reynn: they were arguing because there were spots reserved and crazy and furball wanted to steal them but rick got pissy because they thought of his acting as irrational
2017-08-27 14:05:23.674000 - reynn: there was drama going on i had to difuse the situation
2017-08-27 14:05:19.944000 - SlimShadyIAm: Oh just read mod logs

2017-08-26 20:09:38.767000 - reynn: i hated it because i had to do it with basic shapes in c4d
2017-08-26 20:09:22.324000 - reynn: hey <@200018553653428225> i once had to model a pizza and apply textures off the internet on it
2017-08-26 19:49:03.549000 - reynn:
2017-08-26 19:48:20.469000 - reynn: and this reminded me of it
2017-08-26 19:48:15.795000 - reynn: angelcake is the fluffiest cake i know
2017-08-26 19:47:56.100000 - SpectrumW: That's a better name, call it that.

2017-08-26 19:47:19.134000 - reynn: <@207512164544544769> thinking of the pink cake backpack being called "Pink Frosted Angelcake Pouch"

2017-08-26 19:42:57.496000 - reynn:
2017-08-26 19:42:52.081000 - reynn: shading is literally done with the colors that were provided in the palette
2017-08-26 19:42:41.321000 - reynn: this is a given palette
2017-08-26 19:42:07.550000 - qloo: ah!!! that's a nice video
2017-08-26 19:41:55.151000 - reynn: i've been experimenting with strict palettes last few weeks honestly

2017-08-26 19:37:58.438000 - AbsentHiya: probably
2017-08-26 19:37:54.139000 - reynn: im just as sleepy as drowsy you are
2017-08-26 19:37:43.218000 - AbsentHiya: crying

2017-08-26 19:37:36.914000 - reynn: water filled in
2017-08-26 19:37:36.453000 - AbsentHiya: look i know im drowsy but why didnt you just say water
2017-08-26 19:37:30.472000 - reynn: and water balloons can only be made with the water coolers
2017-08-26 19:37:29.153000 - AbsentHiya: 'squirt filled in'
2017-08-26 19:37:19.491000 - reynn: squirt guns would have to get squirt filled in through the water cooler
2017-08-26 19:36:33.120000 - AbsentHiya: why not both
2017-08-26 19:36:24.560000 - reynn: or water balloons
2017-08-26 19:36:21.927000 - reynn: and we either attack with squirt guns
2017-08-26 19:36:21.638000 - AbsentHiya: thats much better
2017-08-26 19:36:20.207000 - AbsentHiya: yes
2017-08-26 19:36:15.112000 - reynn: water coolers for the other group right
2017-08-26 19:36:06.168000 - reynn: but what about

2017-08-26 19:35:49.065000 - reynn: <@!211862557726605313> me and the artists figured it out
2017-08-26 19:22:14.985000 - reynn: i really don't understand the blue text tbh
2017-08-26 19:21:56.342000 - reynn: also what do the toons do when they open the doors
2017-08-26 19:21:38.673000 - AbsentHiya: huh
2017-08-26 19:21:07.124000 - reynn: especially nowadays when we're teaching kids that scrap electronics can be put into special containers, scrap can be dangerous for kids and it shouldn't be considered a toy which we might as well make it since it's gonna be the "gag"
2017-08-26 19:20:06.014000 - reynn: i don't think throwing scrap electronics is good
2017-08-26 19:18:44.772000 - AbsentHiya: then u will understand the battle
2017-08-26 19:18:39.427000 - AbsentHiya: and qloo

2017-08-26 19:17:32.700000 - reynn: <@!190864079634694144> green light on dislikes toons and spills
2017-08-26 19:17:29.485000 - Jake S.: lol

2017-08-26 19:17:27.202000 - Jake S.: then it isnt bad
2017-08-26 19:17:20.561000 - reynn: spills are the nightmare of every it person
2017-08-26 19:17:18.669000 - AbsentHiya: i posted the concept 2-3 months back publicly
2017-08-26 19:17:08.753000 - AbsentHiya: squirt guns
2017-08-26 19:17:07.984000 - reynn: because i really feels like dislikes toons and spills could be perfect
2017-08-26 19:17:06.853000 - AbsentHiya: yeah thats also one of the things used to destroy the tech
2017-08-26 19:17:06.542000 - Jake S.: so it was lEAKED?
2017-08-26 19:16:51.634000 - AbsentHiya: <@205508288584876033> yes thats bad
2017-08-26 19:16:51.074000 - reynn: can we somehow implement squirt
2017-08-26 19:16:36.362000 - AbsentHiya: smh
2017-08-26 19:16:30.487000 - reynn: it's too long
2017-08-26 19:16:27.440000 - reynn: sry i just skimmed through the thing
2017-08-26 19:16:26.177000 - AbsentHiya: but instead they just destroy everything
2017-08-26 19:16:20.734000 - AbsentHiya: their job was intended to be tech repairs if they were cogs
2017-08-26 19:16:11.862000 - AbsentHiya: toons arent repairing tech
2017-08-26 19:16:01.841000 - reynn: rather than repair tech
2017-08-26 19:15:56.269000 - reynn: wouldn't it be better to have running up to date tech but the toons have to destroy it to get to the cio?
2017-08-26 19:15:40.513000 - AbsentHiya: yeah
2017-08-26 19:15:30.770000 - reynn: hypothetically
2017-08-26 19:15:27.590000 - reynn: <@!211862557726605313> i'm just wondering
2017-08-26 19:13:31.572000 - reynn: but that's also good
2017-08-26 19:13:26.072000 - reynn: i was thinking spills instead
2017-08-26 19:13:14.524000 - reynn: dislikes toons, outdated operating systems
2017-08-26 19:10:25.681000 - Jake S.: ah ok

2017-08-26 19:08:23.964000 - AbsentHiya: that explains the majority of it
2017-08-26 19:08:17.396000 - AbsentHiya: you will find the main CIO concept
2017-08-26 19:08:10.986000 - AbsentHiya: qloo if you scroll far up in concepts

2017-08-26 19:06:31.404000 - reynn: because she's making a trading card for the cio
2017-08-26 19:06:16.682000 - reynn: see we need to know what like happens not what's inside
2017-08-26 19:06:03.630000 - reynn: that's not what q asked for
2017-08-26 19:05:51.899000 - AbsentHiya: you forgot the maze and the random techbot drop in

2017-08-26 19:04:38.809000 - Kyle: Then a workshop area where you have to fix some technology
2017-08-26 19:04:26.041000 - Kyle: No cogs yet
2017-08-26 19:04:14.424000 - Kyle: *belt

2017-08-26 17:14:30.879000 - Stormish: Okay.
2017-08-26 17:14:27.206000 - Spencer: I'll try it out in a minute
2017-08-26 17:14:19.917000 - Spencer: I think I get it
2017-08-26 17:14:11.975000 - Spencer: alright thanks
2017-08-26 17:13:57.407000 - Stormish: and that is all.
2017-08-26 17:13:54.892000 - Stormish: and replace the group name with the removed Joint
2017-08-26 17:13:45.432000 - Stormish: You might as well also remove the extra joint Panda3D adds when you export the model from Maya to an egg file.
2017-08-26 17:13:12.540000 - Stormish: This is an example by the way
2017-08-26 17:12:56.269000 - Stormish: You understand how it works now?
2017-08-26 17:12:50.195000 - Stormish: ```egg-optchar -d C:\Panda3D-1.10.0\bin\ -flag arms -expose def_head```
2017-08-26 17:11:53.098000 - Stormish: You'd do something like this
2017-08-26 17:11:39.433000 - Stormish: use egg-optchar with these models
2017-08-26 17:11:24.447000 - Stormish: so if you do want to
2017-08-26 17:10:55.288000 - Stormish: and by exposed, I mean these joints can be used with the find function without needing to expose the joint with the exposeJoint function
2017-08-26 17:10:21.765000 - Stormish: These joints are exposed
2017-08-26 17:10:12.033000 - Stormish: I'm talking about those below torso-top
2017-08-26 17:09:56.685000 - Stormish: You see those joints, yes?
2017-08-26 17:09:41.087000 - Stormish:
2017-08-26 17:09:01.677000 - Stormish: Well it goes something like this
2017-08-26 17:08:52.347000 - Spencer: that i need to change
2017-08-26 17:08:49.002000 - Spencer: right, you mentioned egg-optchar but I'm not familiar with the specifics
2017-08-26 17:08:29.212000 - Stormish: in a DM that is
2017-08-26 17:08:25.243000 - Stormish: if you want, I can actually tell you what to do.
2017-08-26 17:07:35.934000 - Stormish: with egg-optchar
2017-08-26 17:07:32.238000 - Stormish: You'd have to expose some joints and also flag the models
2017-08-26 17:07:07.870000 - Stormish: If you do wanna fix some stuff like the Joints not following each other right
2017-08-26 17:06:51.538000 - Stormish: Well to explain it to Spencer
2017-08-26 17:06:07.407000 - Spencer: so like editing the actual toon body models
2017-08-26 17:06:03.264000 - reynn: but that idea also isn't bad
2017-08-26 17:05:55.630000 - Stormish: I see
2017-08-26 17:05:51.159000 - reynn: tops

2017-08-26 17:05:26.934000 - reynn: nono
2017-08-26 17:05:20.440000 - Jake S.: or if you have the winter scarf on, put a backpack on too
2017-08-26 17:05:12.993000 - Jake S.: you coul dhave a backpack too
2017-08-26 17:05:09.711000 - Jake S.: like if we added jackets

2017-08-26 14:42:49.479000 - Spencer: i was able to save the animation into the model itself

2017-08-26 14:19:54.129000 - reynn: the artists have to debate because each of us has different experiences
2017-08-26 14:18:52.834000 - SlimShadyIAm: anyways it was just an idea
2017-08-26 14:18:49.474000 - SlimShadyIAm: i call this survival of the artist heh
2017-08-26 14:16:54.888000 - reynn: and how much the colors would stay true
2017-08-26 14:16:42.330000 - reynn: the thing about gif is that i'd worry about the quality
2017-08-26 14:16:17.140000 - Spencer: all three options work
2017-08-26 14:16:13.627000 - Spencer: you could use either an mp4 or gif texture, or just animate the model
2017-08-26 14:16:01.386000 - brady: making a gif texture should work fine
2017-08-26 14:15:31.822000 - reynn: but i can't really imagine anything else that could be done with the goggles other than the lenses spinning lol if i understand uv maps correctly the texture should stay on the model put so if you spin it i think the texture will spin too but i haven't really tried that yet with anyone
2017-08-26 14:14:16.508000 - brady: but then youd have spinning lenses
2017-08-26 14:14:04.042000 - reynn: you could just make the glass spin
2017-08-26 14:13:59.669000 - reynn: hypothetically if the model could be broken into objects
2017-08-26 14:13:42.952000 - reynn: i don't think you'd even have to do that
2017-08-26 14:13:30.709000 - brady: you would have to make a gif texture for it
2017-08-26 14:13:20.194000 - brady: animating hypno goggles wouldnt be animating models
2017-08-26 14:12:18.435000 - SlimShadyIAm: DO IT

2017-08-26 14:02:04.217000 - Spencer: I'll make a couple first I guess then you can formulate opinions
2017-08-26 14:01:50.834000 - Disyer: weird

2017-08-26 13:49:57.637000 - Disyer: would be able to give the same feel
2017-08-26 13:49:53.298000 - Disyer: im not sure that a small playground imitating the old beta TTC
2017-08-26 13:49:47.146000 - SlimShadyIAm: better idea
2017-08-26 13:49:44.197000 - SlimShadyIAm: let's add microtransactions

2017-08-26 13:48:46.300000 - Spencer: i think his reasoning was "its shaped like mickey"
2017-08-26 13:48:36.161000 - Disyer: it would make no sense to just throw it away
2017-08-26 13:48:32.336000 - Disyer: TTC is like the most iconic playground in the game
2017-08-26 13:48:26.289000 - Spencer: yes nw

2017-08-26 13:47:23.949000 - Disyer: why do we have to redo TTC?
2017-08-26 13:46:25.988000 - reynn: i don't even remember at this point what the hell

2017-08-26 08:50:47.295000 - Spencer: Look at the left, you can clearly see a bird toon that is not a duck
2017-08-26 08:50:18.167000 - Spencer: And I found this

2017-08-26 06:18:07.724000 - reynn: also maybe have a little bit of grain
2017-08-26 06:18:02.098000 - reynn: the grass could be more spotty
2017-08-26 06:17:56.449000 - reynn: like the path could use some grain
2017-08-26 06:17:48.220000 - reynn: and i think both could use some texture
2017-08-26 06:17:33.452000 - reynn: the grass is too minty and the path seems to be too dark
2017-08-26 06:17:22.952000 - Spencer: It's in phase 4

2017-08-26 04:26:41.507000 - Spencer: nosyliam wew
2017-08-26 04:25:36.090000 - Frank: lmao I remember when nosyliam applied for standard

2017-08-26 04:22:50.171000 - Spencer: Because Brady pressured me to

2017-08-26 04:21:27.095000 - AbsentHiya: we tried to hire him a few months ago and he never finished the test model
2017-08-26 04:21:14.396000 - AbsentHiya: why is danktown trash
2017-08-26 04:20:07.506000 - Frank: Sounds like a plan
2017-08-26 04:18:48.106000 - Spencer: That's the goal at least
2017-08-26 04:18:34.015000 - Spencer: Then of course disyer implements and gives it treasure spawns, proper fishing, proper NPC placement, and teleport points
2017-08-26 04:17:36.135000 - Spencer: And then Frank can make the dna
2017-08-26 04:17:30.558000 - Spencer: At which point I'll pass it over to triangles so he can give it collisions
2017-08-26 04:17:08.963000 - Spencer: I'll start on the buildings after I finish the model for the new ttc
2017-08-26 04:16:17.100000 - Spencer: Danktown is a fucking garbage person
2017-08-26 04:15:58.210000 - Spencer: This community is at a deficiency of modelers honestly, I'd suggest you hire anyone decent as long as they aren't danktown
2017-08-26 04:14:35.743000 - Frank: Helllooo
2017-08-26 04:14:27.013000 - Spencer: The buildings are gonna need a lot of textures tho

2017-08-26 04:12:54.057000 - Spencer: That's bc he is easily distracted
2017-08-26 04:12:49.085000 - AbsentHiya: I'd talk to frank

2017-08-26 04:11:11.337000 - Spencer: And the progress started when stride was a wip
2017-08-26 04:10:56.027000 - Spencer: He was working on it actively since April 2016 tho

2017-08-25 23:01:08.197000 - Spencer: brady

2017-08-25 22:44:24.433000 - brady:
2017-08-25 22:37:16.080000 - AbsentHiya: change the green
2017-08-25 22:36:42.475000 - Spencer: could just be cream and pink
2017-08-25 22:36:31.824000 - brady: i like the pink though
2017-08-25 22:36:15.515000 - brady: ok then
2017-08-25 22:36:08.579000 - Spencer: that mint + pink is still really offputting to me
2017-08-25 22:35:39.258000 - Spencer: oh yeah that
2017-08-25 22:35:14.533000 - brady:

2017-08-25 22:33:14.378000 - brady: ok good
2017-08-25 22:33:12.682000 - Spencer: it uses a model
2017-08-25 22:33:09.577000 - Spencer: thats easy
2017-08-25 22:32:57.759000 - brady: we would need someone to edit the logo in game so it fits the thing
2017-08-25 22:32:49.583000 - reynn: You could end it with the letters
2017-08-25 22:32:42.371000 - Spencer: i wasnt sure where to end it yeah
2017-08-25 22:32:42.025000 - reynn: If the letters were connected
2017-08-25 22:32:28.639000 - reynn: I think it's odd how the cream ends between the lines
2017-08-25 22:32:05.504000 - brady: i like it but how would it appear in game
2017-08-25 22:31:48.308000 - Spencer: alright but what about the design in general
2017-08-25 22:31:28.774000 - brady: fuck if only i could fine the old one i made
2017-08-25 22:31:27.990000 - reynn: Yellow is generally the happy color mental wise
2017-08-25 22:31:26.177000 - AbsentHiya: aaaaaa
2017-08-25 22:31:25.262000 - AbsentHiya: i dont like those colours at all
2017-08-25 22:31:08.589000 - reynn: These colors are too monotone
2017-08-25 22:30:55.593000 - reynn: Toontown white dessert storm yellow
2017-08-25 22:30:44.103000 - Spencer: alternate

2017-08-25 22:28:09.198000 - Spencer: i wasnt sure about the color for the letters
2017-08-25 22:27:41.447000 - Jake S.: just looks off with color
2017-08-25 22:27:30.306000 - Jake S.: I feel like the cream ends too early
2017-08-25 22:26:54.183000 - Spencer:
2017-08-25 22:26:13.937000 - Jake S.: no lets just put the concept as our logo <:Kappa:328341579095998474>
2017-08-25 22:25:10.972000 - brady: of course this stuff would look way better in a final product
2017-08-25 22:24:39.240000 - qloo: i guess it could work?? like, it does help make the "toontown" part look nicer
2017-08-25 22:24:29.247000 - brady: thanks
2017-08-25 22:24:20.840000 - Rare: i like the  new concept btw

2017-08-25 22:23:11.357000 - qloo: though i'm not too like, familiar with designs i feel that it's pretty good and more or less stands out from the rest of the other private server logos
2017-08-25 22:22:32.506000 - qloo: i think that the latest one looks pretty good
2017-08-25 22:21:10.239000 - qloo: ok

2017-08-25 21:27:12.527000 - Spencer: heres my thoughts: if the words "dessert storm" are given a chocolate-like color and texture, the whipped cream and the splat could be enough to hold it up instead of needed to add random objects

2017-08-25 20:44:47.784000 - brady: im gonna take a shower real quick
2017-08-25 20:40:54.455000 - Spencer: Here lemme try something
2017-08-25 20:38:49.093000 - Jake S.: <:smartThink:339277176178212864>
2017-08-25 20:38:44.238000 - Jake S.: yes thats because we have a magical game
2017-08-25 20:38:40.837000 - brady: lmao
2017-08-25 20:38:30.818000 - reynn: also the ice cream is just levitating in your concept
2017-08-25 20:38:22.674000 - reynn: the cloud and splatter can be always smaller
2017-08-25 20:38:12.285000 - reynn: <@191661929905913856> <@175594692237328384> i think the width depends on the font
2017-08-25 20:37:57.690000 - brady:
2017-08-25 20:37:06.519000 - Spencer: A new desktop icon also might be nice to go along with the logo depending on what gets chosen
2017-08-25 20:36:44.247000 - Spencer: I feel like having too many gimmicks in the logo clutters it up
2017-08-25 20:36:18.850000 - Disyer: the second is good too however
2017-08-25 20:36:04.022000 - Disyer: but the second is too wide i think
2017-08-25 20:35:58.166000 - Disyer: the first is pretty god
2017-08-25 20:35:49.365000 - reynn: thought so
2017-08-25 20:35:39.542000 - Disyer: the 3rd one where the cloud is seperated is a no go
2017-08-25 20:34:43.501000 - reynn: <@175594692237328384>

2017-08-25 20:34:06.769000 - reynn: give feedback
2017-08-25 20:34:03.014000 - reynn: scroll up
2017-08-25 20:34:00.530000 - reynn: brady made a concept too
2017-08-25 20:33:54.792000 - reynn: <@175594692237328384>
2017-08-25 20:33:52.100000 - brady: in both
2017-08-25 20:33:42.657000 - Disyer: the one on the bottom is better
2017-08-25 20:33:37.433000 - reynn: but in which one
2017-08-25 20:33:16.113000 - brady: i think the cloud and splatter take too much room
2017-08-25 20:32:56.637000 - Spencer: Since it makes me think about zap gags
2017-08-25 20:32:40.483000 - Spencer: I like the concept Brady came up with, I don't really know how I feel about the lightning strike
2017-08-25 20:32:39.304000 - Jake S.: and on the right side its a storm
2017-08-25 20:32:35.921000 - Jake S.: what if on the left side, the cloud rained like sauce
2017-08-25 20:32:24.623000 - Jake S.: baru
2017-08-25 20:32:06.371000 - Jake S.: I like the second one
2017-08-25 20:31:54.388000 - reynn:
2017-08-25 20:31:53.446000 - reynn:
2017-08-25 20:31:38.186000 - reynn: which one of the layouts do you like better
2017-08-25 20:31:35.526000 - reynn: also
2017-08-25 20:31:18.997000 - brady: lemme see
2017-08-25 20:31:06.480000 - reynn: hmmm where would you like the ice cream cone
2017-08-25 20:31:03.100000 - Jake S.: a cream pie is considered a dessert tbh
2017-08-25 20:30:57.783000 - Jake S.: what if we sought to bringing throw gags into it
2017-08-25 20:30:39.475000 - brady: so im likingo the use of the lightning shocking the cog gear and a ice cream cone
2017-08-25 20:30:04.255000 - brady: ok
2017-08-25 20:29:57.835000 - reynn: xd
2017-08-25 20:29:57.389000 - reynn: it's really hard with the word dessert
2017-08-25 20:29:46.565000 - reynn: idk like i'd implement more gags into my concept it's just
2017-08-25 20:29:19.129000 - brady: but i like the shocked cog gear
2017-08-25 20:29:04.079000 - brady: yeah
2017-08-25 20:29:00.949000 - reynn: to the previous one
2017-08-25 20:28:58.228000 - reynn: is still is very similar
2017-08-25 20:28:54.614000 - brady: its not actually gonna be in a box
2017-08-25 20:28:42.160000 - brady: i was just putting a placeholder for the operation/ toontown
2017-08-25 20:28:30.914000 - Jake S.: ya good point
2017-08-25 20:28:18.576000 - reynn: just rearrangment
2017-08-25 20:28:13.074000 - reynn: it's really not bringing nothing that new
2017-08-25 20:28:02.543000 - reynn: if we do it the way you sketched it out
2017-08-25 20:27:48.091000 - reynn: we're kinda keeping the logo the same as it was this way minus ice cream, moving toontown into a rectangle rather than storm and adding a gear instead of o
2017-08-25 20:26:48.442000 - brady: but i got lazy
2017-08-25 20:26:42.637000 - brady: hooked up to another gear
2017-08-25 20:26:35.607000 - brady: i tried to make a gear
2017-08-25 20:26:30.097000 - brady: lmao
2017-08-25 20:26:27.659000 - reynn: the o looks weird
2017-08-25 20:26:21.403000 - reynn: what's wrong with the o tbh
2017-08-25 20:26:06.802000 - brady:
2017-08-25 20:25:51.823000 - Jake S.:
2017-08-25 20:25:07.914000 - Jake S.: 500000px
2017-08-25 20:25:05.442000 - reynn: <@191661929905913856>
2017-08-25 20:24:56.960000 - reynn: lol how big do you want the text
2017-08-25 20:24:41.653000 - Jake S.: so its bigger
2017-08-25 20:24:37.940000 - Jake S.: what if we had the toontown splat kinda overshadowing the storm cloud
2017-08-25 20:23:51.407000 - Jake S.: thinking face
2017-08-25 20:23:36.591000 - reynn: <@205508288584876033>
2017-08-25 20:23:35.283000 - reynn:
2017-08-25 20:20:30.914000 - Jake S.: you're unbalanced üò≠
2017-08-25 20:20:24.985000 - reynn: that makes the logo unbalanced
2017-08-25 20:20:12.463000 - Jake S.: just make it into a lil cloud
2017-08-25 20:20:09.233000 - Jake S.:
2017-08-25 20:19:32.313000 - reynn: it's a storm, storm cloud is an actual gag
2017-08-25 20:19:18.251000 - reynn: eh
2017-08-25 20:19:17.864000 - reynn: that's just
2017-08-25 20:19:14.983000 - reynn: i don't want to make a logo with random gags just flying around it
2017-08-25 20:19:04.209000 - reynn: it's a storm hence the storm cloud
2017-08-25 20:18:55.426000 - reynn: but like
2017-08-25 20:18:48.292000 - Jake S.: sketch off
2017-08-25 20:18:27.748000 - brady: let me sketch something up real quick
2017-08-25 20:18:19.824000 - brady: i mean i would prefer it to have no cloud
2017-08-25 20:17:50.946000 - reynn: is the cloud better
2017-08-25 20:17:42.657000 - reynn: <@191661929905913856>
2017-08-25 20:15:10.033000 - Jake S.: yes
2017-08-25 20:14:02.440000 - SlimShadyIAm: dude kicking on the modcp is broken
2017-08-25 20:12:26.243000 - SlimShadyIAm: ?*
2017-08-25 20:12:18.811000 - SlimShadyIAm: >
2017-08-25 20:12:17.583000 - SlimShadyIAm: new name = new domain>
2017-08-25 20:12:14.813000 - brady: also i feel like the clouds are just a little much and i would prefer the structure of it to be more vertical
2017-08-25 20:11:47.870000 - reynn: i was considering looking on dafont
2017-08-25 20:11:43.013000 - reynn: i like the idea of the cartoony look. do you still wanna use a nondisney one?
2017-08-25 20:11:15.279000 - brady: i suggest to just scrap the old fucking custom font i used <@!139483077079597056>
2017-08-25 20:10:59.205000 - SlimShadyIAm: "C"
2017-08-25 20:10:48.154000 - brady: so the logo

2017-08-25 19:25:53.948000 - Jake S.: >poll which one u like moar|Toontown: DessertStorm/TTDS|Operation Dessert Storm/ODS
2017-08-25 19:25:35.364000 - reynn: we can publicly announce it
2017-08-25 19:25:29.724000 - reynn: and the old ones will know it's ods but you can search it as toontown dessert storm
2017-08-25 19:25:10.955000 - reynn: new people will get used to tds/ttds
2017-08-25 19:25:00.338000 - reynn: so i think it's okay to change it
2017-08-25 19:24:59.215000 - Jake S.: look its sheepy
2017-08-25 19:24:41.442000 - Jake S.: Yes
2017-08-25 19:24:29.999000 - reynn: i think people are going to be used to operation dessert storm but disyer is right about the search results
2017-08-25 19:22:38.599000 - Jake S.: idk ODS is more appealing than TTDS
2017-08-25 19:20:15.418000 - Triangle (Andrew) Vance: age 13 and he isn't self dependent? LOL!!!!! <@175594692237328384>
2017-08-25 19:18:44.584000 - reynn: So change the operation part to toontown
2017-08-25 19:17:53.442000 - Disyer: Address: 11821 77th Ave E AND THE NIGGA LIVES WITH HIS PARENTS LOOOOOOL
2017-08-25 19:17:51.094000 - Spencer: Anyway yeah I'd say change the logo to say Toontown: Dessert Storm so people eventually stop calling it ods right
2017-08-25 19:17:42.963000 - reynn: Kms
2017-08-25 19:17:40.739000 - reynn: I'm about to turn 18 and I'm still with my parents:'(
2017-08-25 19:17:26.409000 - Disyer: yes
2017-08-25 19:17:25.441000 - reynn: You're still cool
2017-08-25 19:17:21.223000 - reynn: Aren't you like 15 or 16 tho
2017-08-25 19:17:15.974000 - Spencer: Oof
2017-08-25 19:15:55.645000 - Disyer: yeah me too
2017-08-25 19:14:35.445000 - reynn: I'm so late
2017-08-25 19:14:29.238000 - reynn: Age 13
2017-08-25 19:14:25.313000 - reynn: Fuck
2017-08-25 19:14:17.275000 - Triangle (Andrew) Vance: WOW HE LIVES WITH HIS PARENTS AT AGE 13!!!
2017-08-25 19:13:09.296000 - Disyer: at any rate, still living with parents at age 13?
2017-08-25 19:12:59.127000 - Disyer: ask pastebin <@279154943783337984>
2017-08-25 19:12:49.010000 - Triangle (Andrew) Vance: Is that his last name
2017-08-25 19:12:41.010000 - Triangle (Andrew) Vance: yes
2017-08-25 19:12:39.350000 - Triangle (Andrew) Vance: <@139483077079597056> Chandler stoule says that
2017-08-25 19:12:15.464000 - Disyer: brady didnt tell us , but he is an art professor at CMU
2017-08-25 19:12:01.568000 - qloo: stop repeating that triangle man
2017-08-25 19:11:55.271000 - reynn: xd
2017-08-25 19:11:54.732000 - reynn: who says that
2017-08-25 19:11:51.666000 - reynn: wtf lol
2017-08-25 19:11:29.774000 - Triangle (Andrew) Vance: that's knots in socks
2017-08-25 19:11:22.445000 - reynn: just think if i did it with the correct palette that it could be good
2017-08-25 19:11:05.721000 - reynn: 3 years of art school got me far enough
2017-08-25 19:10:59.153000 - reynn: all good i can deal with it
2017-08-25 19:10:08.641000 - Jake S.: <@!139483077079597056> prepare
2017-08-25 19:10:04.053000 - Disyer: prepare
2017-08-25 19:10:02.673000 - Disyer: shit
2017-08-25 19:10:01.426000 - Jake S.: xd
2017-08-25 19:09:57.923000 - brady: then ill criticize harshly
2017-08-25 19:09:51.193000 - brady: im out in 30 mins
2017-08-25 19:09:44.672000 - brady: lmao
2017-08-25 19:09:43.405000 - Jake S.: instead of Operation: in the cloud, put a toontown logo in there
2017-08-25 19:09:43.226000 - brady: im at school
2017-08-25 19:09:36.792000 - Disyer: compared to https://www.google.fr/search?q=operation+dessert+storm lol
2017-08-25 19:09:24.847000 - Disyer: https://www.google.fr/search?q=toontown+dessert+storm definitely better SEO
2017-08-25 19:09:23.761000 - Jake S.: then lets add in a toontown-style logo
2017-08-25 19:08:55.405000 - Disyer: so its Toontown: Dessert Storm now
2017-08-25 19:08:50.765000 - Disyer: it just sends you to the gulf war operation
2017-08-25 19:08:44.924000 - Disyer: cuz of the shitty SEO you get when you type that in google
2017-08-25 19:08:38.295000 - Disyer: we dont really say Operation Dessert Storm anymore right?
2017-08-25 19:08:32.586000 - Disyer: well one way to justify a new logo would be..
2017-08-25 19:08:26.467000 - Disyer: well thats my line of thought too, we dont really need a new logo unless necessary
2017-08-25 18:57:31.900000 - SlimShadyIAm: it looks fine
2017-08-25 18:57:29.897000 - SlimShadyIAm: honestly i like the current logo
2017-08-25 18:43:40.237000 - reynn: I'll surely play with the colors
2017-08-25 18:43:28.824000 - reynn: Because i plan on making the lightning and the outline of storm yellow
2017-08-25 18:43:02.257000 - reynn: Rather color it cream as in vanilla
2017-08-25 18:42:52.849000 - reynn: I definitely wouldn't do chocolate sauce on the font
2017-08-25 18:42:30.864000 - reynn: And the palette would have to fit together well
2017-08-25 18:42:21.714000 - reynn: The colors would have to be mild
2017-08-25 18:42:08.873000 - reynn: It's just a sketch currently
2017-08-25 18:41:40.312000 - Spencer: If Brady was up he might have some better insight since he has more experience than I do
2017-08-25 18:41:28.675000 - Alex/LsR: but you have a point
2017-08-25 18:41:21.186000 - Spencer: Right
2017-08-25 18:41:16.341000 - Alex/LsR: well we can always see rough drafts and go from there
2017-08-25 18:40:52.536000 - Spencer: I think every single word in the logo having a different look to it could make the logo a bit of an eyesore, but idk
2017-08-25 18:39:57.782000 - Alex/LsR:
2017-08-25 18:39:22.893000 - Triangle (Andrew) Vance: New playground that gets taken over by cogs: the dessert desert
We need to storm the dessert desert
Operation dessert storm
2017-08-25 18:38:37.132000 - reynn: thank you
2017-08-25 18:38:35.336000 - reynn: that's a very good idea
2017-08-25 18:38:32.040000 - reynn: i could do a topping yes
2017-08-25 18:38:28.546000 - reynn: ooh yeah
2017-08-25 18:38:22.160000 - Alex/LsR: yeah so like chocolate sauce and sprinkles and all that good unhealthy stuff
2017-08-25 18:37:59.223000 - Triangle (Andrew) Vance: make it a dessert desert yes

2017-08-20 21:44:06.511000 - Spencer: the only reason i really gave the modified models as a suggestion is that these two props:

2017-08-20 05:13:01.202000 - brady: we wait then
2017-08-20 05:02:44.018000 - AbsentHiya: ok no I don't want to say no to someone just because someone can do two things

2017-08-20 03:37:11.644000 - brady: but we should wait for other apps to choose from
2017-08-20 03:37:07.649000 - Spencer: The one they made looks organic and made out of the unfiltered plantlife instead of lumber
2017-08-20 03:37:00.306000 - brady: yeah
2017-08-20 03:36:45.088000 - Spencer: I think the theme might have been interpreted wrong

2017-08-19 09:40:04.187000 - Disyer: which dont work on the ODS client due to being sandboxed
2017-08-19 09:39:56.037000 - Disyer: it depends on modules, like urllib2 or httplib

2017-08-19 07:16:37.706000 - masterjumblespeed: > Our lead dev will be making an official statement in the morning (as it's rather late currently), however I assure you that PicklezRickz's claims are invalid. ODS most certainly does not "steal" passwords. There is no such function in our source code (and there never will be), and everyone's passwords are securely hashed in our site's DB so that we couldn't read them even if we needed to. This is likely the post in question: https://www.reddit.com/r/Toontown/comments/6umkdi/psa_ods_stealing_passwords/

2017-08-18 05:17:42.757000 - masterjumblespeed: so you could add
2017-08-18 05:17:33.585000 - masterjumblespeed: `    searchq = request.GET.get('searchq', None)
    searchtype = request.GET.get('searchtype', None)
    if (s != None for s in (searchq, searchtype)) and (searchtype in ('category', 'reporter', 'reportee')):`
2017-08-18 05:17:31.858000 - masterjumblespeed: there's also a way to search reports if you need it

2017-08-18 05:05:28.785000 - AbsentHiya: then the grouping disappears if the reports are all checked off
2017-08-18 05:05:16.999000 - AbsentHiya: remove the time limit or make it more than 200 hours

2017-08-18 03:03:48.132000 - SlimShadyIAm: I tried setting the site up on my laptop and it wouldn't work either

2017-08-18 01:47:31.790000 - AbsentHiya: the group would show all of the reports, checked off or not, for a specific account ID
2017-08-18 01:47:07.495000 - masterjumblespeed: so the group would just show all active reports that haven't been checked off yet instead of last 48 hrs

2017-08-17 16:07:37.093000 - Frank: Okay
2017-08-17 15:20:21.187000 - Spencer: Although I'll probably just keep working on the model I already have in progress
2017-08-17 15:19:48.344000 - Spencer: A couple of the existing props like the trashcans in DD and MML look very similar to the concept art Brady has made
2017-08-17 13:20:11.135000 - Frank: We just need a couple new props
2017-08-17 13:19:59.273000 - Frank: but we can do the hydrant retexture shit
2017-08-17 13:19:47.182000 - Frank: It's be better to create our own
2017-08-17 13:18:27.665000 - Spencer: Especially for the hydrants
2017-08-17 13:18:22.200000 - Spencer: Good point
2017-08-17 13:11:36.382000 - Disyer: you know we can just retexture some other street prop from another neighborhood
2017-08-17 13:09:21.402000 - Kyle: Yeah, I doubt anyone will miss animations
2017-08-17 12:51:12.856000 - Jake S.: <@200018553653428225> I wouldn't put that very high on the priority list. We can release without animations if we need to
2017-08-17 11:16:46.852000 - Spencer: I mean ok but the street props kinda need animations
2017-08-17 11:05:55.464000 - AbsentHiya: animator isn't our priority right now
2017-08-17 11:04:40.515000 - Spencer: Also you might want to set up an application for an animator position as well
2017-08-17 11:04:24.471000 - Spencer: Is a concept artist really needed?
2017-08-17 11:03:46.380000 - Jake S.: !!!

2017-08-16 00:32:53.669000 - brady: and its a rare occasion that this invades a playground during a sellbot invasion
2017-08-16 00:31:56.362000 - brady: like a giant skelecog
2017-08-16 00:31:42.703000 - brady: what if we had something like the director of ambush marketing
2017-08-16 00:31:31.100000 - brady: hey guys i was thinking of some cool ideas
2017-08-15 23:05:20.357000 - Jake S.: Though I haven't seen it in action myself
2017-08-15 23:05:08.028000 - Jake S.: I think it's different per SOS

2017-08-15 20:48:58.254000 - Spencer: Once again I'd like to express concern in the willingness and skillset of even the most capable of animators in this community (namely Swag Foreman) to rig three new models and over one dozen new animations for these props, especially with how detailed, articulate, and organic the animations of the street props in tto were
2017-08-15 20:43:46.996000 - Spencer: not recently tho
2017-08-15 20:43:44.709000 - Spencer: ive seen some people post neat textures there before

2017-08-12 00:01:11.593000 - masterjumblespeed: <@211862557726605313> so you're saying if you chatted in the game rn you'd have to set the chat logs to 8:01pm instead of 5:01pm
2017-08-11 23:56:41.417000 - masterjumblespeed: it's not supposed to but maybe there's a tz glitch somewhere
2017-08-11 23:54:11.410000 - AbsentHiya: but the calendar follows my time
2017-08-11 23:54:00.187000 - AbsentHiya: like, everything on the site is 3 hours behind my time

2017-08-11 23:49:34.882000 - AbsentHiya: i think the calendar syncs to computer time and not whatever timezone the reports are in
2017-08-11 23:49:20.948000 - AbsentHiya: <@203328996065148928> im also finding that i need to set the start/end times 3 hours later than the reports say

2017-08-09 22:33:17.692000 - Disyer: the reason it breaks, is, possibly because

2017-08-09 22:32:48.644000 - Disyer: and BEYOND

2017-08-09 22:31:39.765000 - Disyer: its 7-18% cpu usage
2017-08-09 22:31:32.281000 - Disyer: but now?
2017-08-09 22:31:31.212000 - Disyer: 60%
2017-08-09 22:31:30.638000 - Disyer: CPU usage would jump to like

2017-08-05 22:36:49.302000 - Alex/LsR: Maybe I could make something with our lord and saviour GoogleDocs
2017-08-05 22:36:32.622000 - Alex/LsR: I suppose I'm thinking more of a spreadsheet
2017-08-05 22:36:30.447000 - qloo: yea lmao

2017-08-05 22:35:05.902000 - qloo: it could always be a "note-for-mods" where you write down the reason for warnings so everybody understands
2017-08-05 22:34:12.549000 - Alex/LsR: That just has a list of people who have been warned
2017-08-05 22:33:54.355000 - Alex/LsR: nah more of a single-post channel
2017-08-05 22:33:40.702000 - AbsentHiya: lmao

2017-08-05 22:33:18.055000 - Alex/LsR: maybe a channel where we can put down people who have been warned
2017-08-05 22:33:08.519000 - Alex/LsR: so your notes wont be for everyone
2017-08-05 22:32:57.654000 - Alex/LsR: notes are client-sided though
2017-08-05 22:32:43.927000 - Triangle (Andrew) Vance: Or utilise the note system discord has in place
2017-08-05 22:32:43.443000 - Alex/LsR: I have the memory of a mentally challenged goldfish
2017-08-05 22:32:11.505000 - qloo: so you dont have to rely on memory
2017-08-05 22:31:53.218000 - qloo: ye

2017-08-05 22:31:41.961000 - Triangle (Andrew) Vance: Yes
2017-08-05 22:31:38.252000 - qloo: a server i mod actually does that, and they assign a role called "Warning 1" "Warning 2" "Warning 3" to people who are warned and stuff
2017-08-05 22:31:36.463000 - Triangle (Andrew) Vance: Strike three
2017-08-05 22:31:32.559000 - Triangle (Andrew) Vance: Strike two

2017-08-05 22:31:15.753000 - qloo: what about a warning system? like you get three warnings then you're kicked out
2017-08-05 22:31:06.816000 - Triangle (Andrew) Vance: Oh
2017-08-05 22:31:05.334000 - Triangle (Andrew) Vance: What

2017-08-05 22:28:17.439000 - Alex/LsR: several bans doesn't sound good
2017-08-05 22:28:11.546000 - Alex/LsR: Oh boy, plot twist
2017-08-05 22:27:53.640000 - AbsentHiya: no that was several bans ago
2017-08-05 22:27:42.722000 - Alex/LsR: My memory of the events were vague
2017-08-05 22:27:29.505000 - Alex/LsR: Wasn't he banned for being overly negative and critical of everything?
2017-08-05 22:27:20.621000 - AbsentHiya: he will 100% be banned again
2017-08-05 22:27:07.843000 - qloo: if you feel that he's going to be more behaved, then yeah, he could be let in. but i kinda feel that you'll have to keep an eye on him

2017-08-05 21:20:24.226000 - Jake S.: <@136254457640910849> You can set parts of your DNA (the DNA is what builds up the toon), ie
~dna torso <0/1/2> to set torso size
~dna head <0/1/2> to set the head type

2017-08-05 05:46:28.448000 - AbsentHiya: however i am actually not sure what to say to this now, yes i could have done something easily yes i didnt have to treat him that way and i apologize

2017-08-05 05:44:47.669000 - Kyle: ^
2017-08-05 05:44:43.777000 - SlimShadyIAm: "no don't invite him" was easier than "what's up with rare"?
2017-08-05 05:44:38.549000 - Kyle: We were cocks
2017-08-05 05:44:36.305000 - Kyle: Don't play stupid man

2017-08-05 05:42:42.205000 - Kyle: ^
2017-08-05 05:42:34.305000 - AbsentHiya: i'll welcome him back if he isnt a dick to everything we say (and ill apologize)

2017-08-05 05:38:02.162000 - Kyle: This was shortly after alej had asked him why he only criticized ideas anymore
2017-08-05 05:37:26.728000 - SlimShadyIAm: I haven't even seen him message
2017-08-05 05:37:26.188000 - AbsentHiya: this is the last time im gonna be blunt about it, but he's been a dick at random points where he didnt have to be

2017-08-05 05:36:27.082000 - SlimShadyIAm: If you didn't want him in here why not bring it up as a proposal to remove him from staff entirely instead of doing.. that?
2017-08-05 05:35:50.802000 - Kyle: At least I can from what i've seen

2017-08-04 20:19:30.985000 - Jake S.: Altis saw that downfall
2017-08-04 20:19:25.172000 - Jake S.: Yep
2017-08-04 20:19:22.570000 - Kyle: Yeah, we only have about 3 players in the UK I think. Too many of us are in the states

2017-08-04 20:11:24.962000 - AbsentHiya: do any of you have the spellbook command list
2017-08-04 20:10:09.256000 - Frank: I was thinking about a system to where you could host the .DNA files off of a webserver
2017-08-04 20:09:52.423000 - Frank: Yeah
2017-08-04 20:09:02.578000 - Disyer: or little payoff
2017-08-04 20:09:00.541000 - Disyer: for no payoff
2017-08-04 20:08:57.035000 - Disyer: maybe that's too much work
2017-08-04 20:08:54.980000 - Disyer: but hmm
2017-08-04 20:08:53.711000 - Disyer: we could create a precompiled file that only has things it needs
2017-08-04 20:08:36.557000 - Disyer: well instead of the server needing to parse the dna
2017-08-04 20:08:27.174000 - Frank: How would that work?
2017-08-04 20:07:55.270000 - Disyer: <@107665382277410816> i really want to get rid of servers needing the resources tbh
2017-08-04 20:06:01.856000 - Frank: Like, have it get the position of interactive props and check the closest one
2017-08-04 20:05:41.835000 - Jake S.: at disyer
2017-08-04 20:05:21.785000 - Frank: You could make it to which one the battle is closest to
2017-08-04 20:05:01.063000 - Disyer: i havent looked into it specifically
2017-08-04 20:04:56.408000 - Disyer: maybe you can
2017-08-04 20:04:55.036000 - Disyer: in the first place
2017-08-04 20:04:53.984000 - Disyer: if you can have 2 battles in one zone
2017-08-04 20:04:51.365000 - Disyer: but im not entirely sure
2017-08-04 20:04:44.036000 - Disyer: that means if you have 2 battles in one zone it'd do the bonus for both battles
2017-08-04 20:04:43.595000 - Frank: Idk why Disney did it that way
2017-08-04 20:04:30.465000 - Disyer: so
2017-08-04 20:04:27.344000 - Disyer: is linked to one zone
2017-08-04 20:04:23.465000 - Disyer: one interactive prop
2017-08-04 20:04:19.233000 - Disyer: i know that
2017-08-04 20:04:15.186000 - Frank: That's why there are so many zones in other streets
2017-08-04 20:04:05.747000 - Frank: Only 1 cell a zonr
2017-08-04 20:04:04.671000 - Disyer: probably
2017-08-04 20:04:00.707000 - Frank: Well the zones
2017-08-04 20:03:54.469000 - Disyer: maps dont handle battle cells
2017-08-04 20:03:48.612000 - Frank: Can it also support multiple battle cells?
2017-08-04 20:03:45.699000 - Disyer: idk what disney was thinking
2017-08-04 20:03:40.526000 - Disyer: that fixed a lot of issues with the map system
2017-08-04 20:03:40.317000 - Frank: Nice
2017-08-04 20:03:35.980000 - Disyer: so one zone can have multiple icons on the map
2017-08-04 20:03:32.379000 - Disyer: that was a big issue but now its handled by block instead of zone i rewrote all that code
2017-08-04 20:03:22.788000 - Frank: He didn't do them whilst creating the street so I gotta set them up
2017-08-04 20:03:19.593000 - Disyer: before, if we hadnt implemented visgroups, one street (without visgroups) could only display one building on the street map
2017-08-04 20:03:10.439000 - Frank: Yeah, it's the biggest pain
2017-08-04 20:03:04.260000 - Disyer: visgroups are a huge one
2017-08-04 20:02:46.987000 - Frank: I have to finish visgroups on Nick's street
2017-08-04 20:02:34.278000 - Frank: Nick did the 2nd one, I did the 1st

2017-08-03 17:57:33.545000 - Jake S.: voidporo is good, but he gets angery easily
2017-08-03 17:57:15.973000 - Triangle (Andrew) Vance: I think we're fine for texture artists? Ask Brady
2017-08-03 17:57:06.690000 - AbsentHiya: nice guy
2017-08-03 17:57:02.857000 - qloo: i know literally nobody in this community lool
2017-08-03 17:56:55.775000 - AbsentHiya: all I know is that he's now an ex Altis texture artist
2017-08-03 17:56:45.688000 - qloo: who
2017-08-03 17:56:45.260000 - AbsentHiya: idk what you mean
2017-08-03 17:56:35.749000 - Triangle (Andrew) Vance: isn't he a leak
2017-08-03 17:56:24.149000 - AbsentHiya: what do you guys think about picking up voidporo
2017-08-03 17:56:17.728000 - Triangle (Andrew) Vance: This is very true
2017-08-03 17:56:13.860000 - Triangle (Andrew) Vance: https://youtu.be/JlOYmzpihcw
2017-08-03 17:56:12.099000 - Triangle (Andrew) Vance: BTW
2017-08-03 17:55:31.833000 - Disyer: that makes sense
2017-08-03 17:55:20.257000 - Triangle (Andrew) Vance: What if you tell it to ignore the cart and just the name tag or some shit
2017-08-03 17:54:59.115000 - Triangle (Andrew) Vance: Well the problem is that the camera is looking at the cart right
2017-08-03 17:54:09.987000 - Disyer: instead of just outright changing the camera position
2017-08-03 17:54:05.852000 - Disyer: and if the camera position changes then itll ease into that
2017-08-03 17:54:01.120000 - Disyer: over time
2017-08-03 17:54:00.180000 - Disyer: and so it will ease into that position
2017-08-03 17:53:55.989000 - Disyer: as set it as a "target position"
2017-08-03 17:53:52.552000 - Disyer: we should intercept that
2017-08-03 17:53:50.491000 - Disyer: when it changes position
2017-08-03 17:53:47.784000 - Disyer: camera
2017-08-03 17:53:45.756000 - Disyer: you know how the
2017-08-03 17:53:43.732000 - Disyer: like
2017-08-03 17:53:43.237000 - Disyer: maybe we can use sequences to smooth them out
2017-08-03 17:53:32.122000 - Disyer: im still thinking of a good solution for that
2017-08-03 17:52:22.127000 - Triangle (Andrew) Vance: so the camera isn't hopping all over the place
2017-08-03 17:52:12.425000 - Triangle (Andrew) Vance: I can smooth out the collisions and then you load those if the cart is loaded
2017-08-03 17:51:50.757000 - Triangle (Andrew) Vance: Disyer I have an idea
2017-08-03 17:51:37.339000 - Disyer: time to automate this one

2017-08-03 17:30:34.353000 - Kyle: <@136254457640910849> It would be cool, but it wouldn't make sense. The VP falls off of the other side of the tower.

2017-08-03 17:08:23.183000 - Disyer: player presses Del key (while in 'walk' state)
2017-08-03 17:08:17.936000 - Disyer: ok so

2017-08-03 17:08:00.208000 - Disyer: it could be achieved using the "Del" key
2017-08-03 17:07:53.416000 - Disyer: i was thinking that
2017-08-03 17:07:45.661000 - Frank: I feel like it should cost a certain amount of beans or earned through toontask
2017-08-03 17:07:26.094000 - Frank: There could be a button
2017-08-03 17:07:12.348000 - Frank: True
2017-08-03 17:07:05.965000 - Disyer: yeah but it would be better if it can be taken out anywhere
2017-08-03 17:06:56.901000 - Frank: Maybe those things at the speedway
2017-08-03 17:06:22.407000 - Disyer: how will players take out the car?
2017-08-03 17:06:18.734000 - Disyer: we need to decide
