2017-08-27 18:34:02.244000 - reynn: nobody is, if you guys know he will do the job well then go for him
2017-08-27 18:33:42.641000 - AbsentHiya: he's great

2017-08-27 18:33:30.901000 - Spencer: that's not very open minded of you
2017-08-27 18:33:28.365000 - AbsentHiya: I'll be open minded to whoever is picked

2017-08-27 18:33:14.955000 - AbsentHiya: I'm not being open minded to two
2017-08-27 18:33:08.192000 - SlimShadyIAm: Now, just discuss who you want and we can vote on it later
2017-08-27 18:33:03.394000 - Spencer: Please be open minded to another one IF NEEDED

2017-08-27 18:32:26.814000 - AbsentHiya: no the issue is that we don't need two
2017-08-27 18:32:26.772000 - Spencer: I don't understand
2017-08-27 18:32:26.262000 - reynn: no it's not adding them there
2017-08-27 18:32:25.376000 - Kyle: Well, it was for a bit
2017-08-27 18:32:21.450000 - SlimShadyIAm: What's the issue?
2017-08-27 18:32:20.368000 - reynn: but why just one
2017-08-27 18:32:19.195000 - Kyle: We have 2 american (me and alej)
2017-08-27 18:32:16.654000 - SlimShadyIAm: Is the issue of adding them to the staff chat?

2017-08-27 18:31:35.352000 - reynn: i'm talking from experience it's just the fact that there should be someone to moderate at all times and i mean discord specifically
2017-08-27 18:31:32.462000 - Kyle: The guy we're trying to make mod is in the UK

2017-08-27 18:30:42.866000 - Spencer: I say we should be open to more than one new mod
2017-08-27 18:30:41.112000 - Kyle: Nobody is against that, yeah?

2017-08-27 18:27:27.585000 - reynn: because when you guys aren't here creative has to step in when things go wrong unless we wanna look like dickheads
2017-08-27 18:27:07.420000 - Spencer: We shouldn't restrict ourselves to one
2017-08-27 18:27:07.386000 - AbsentHiya: ^

2017-08-27 18:20:08.197000 - AbsentHiya: yes
2017-08-27 18:20:05.741000 - Spencer: Right
2017-08-27 18:20:04.082000 - Spencer: Ok so we're getting a new mod then
2017-08-27 18:19:52.529000 - brady: **
2017-08-27 18:19:51.051000 - SlimShadyIAm: Out of pocket
2017-08-27 18:19:49.134000 - brady: cost
2017-08-27 18:19:46.234000 - SlimShadyIAm: Then disyer started paying
2017-08-27 18:19:42.945000 - brady: but that coat too much
2017-08-27 18:19:40.324000 - SlimShadyIAm: Because he had left for a while
2017-08-27 18:19:38.397000 - brady: there was an argument about updating the servers
2017-08-27 18:19:28.476000 - AbsentHiya: I'm pretty sure he still does man
2017-08-27 18:19:26.284000 - SlimShadyIAm: I don't think he does
2017-08-27 18:19:21.608000 - AbsentHiya: he did so I mean we should still give him a little respect
2017-08-27 18:19:18.519000 - brady: i thought he always had
2017-08-27 18:19:16.797000 - SlimShadyIAm: <@175594692237328384> does rare pay for servers now?
2017-08-27 18:19:16.497000 - Kyle: We don't have to work to keep stuff a secret
2017-08-27 18:19:11.154000 - AbsentHiya: wtf
2017-08-27 18:19:09.752000 - AbsentHiya: anymore
2017-08-27 18:19:08.363000 - reynn: does he really?
2017-08-27 18:19:08.124000 - AbsentHiya: not any meow
2017-08-27 18:19:06.573000 - reynn: as slim said, we want to replace them afterall
2017-08-27 18:19:06.116000 - Kyle: "invested in keeping this secret"
2017-08-27 18:19:06.025000 - AbsentHiya: I'm not gonna accept more than one
2017-08-27 18:19:02.668000 - brady: but rare provides money.. right?
2017-08-27 18:18:56.286000 - SlimShadyIAm: Take your time
2017-08-27 18:18:53.801000 - SlimShadyIAm: We don't need to make any quick decisions
2017-08-27 18:18:51.540000 - reynn: we should get two
2017-08-27 18:18:47.932000 - reynn: if alex and rare both drop out
2017-08-27 18:18:44.995000 - brady: mods dont make anything so they really have no reason to be invested in keeping all this content secret
2017-08-27 18:18:42.929000 - reynn: i say two because there's always school
2017-08-27 18:18:40.293000 - AbsentHiya: there wouldn't be a reason it would be an issue
2017-08-27 18:18:35.933000 - reynn: can we get back on the topic of hiring people
2017-08-27 18:18:23.724000 - Kyle: There's not an issue with mods seeing development
2017-08-27 18:18:18.099000 - brady: what im saying is
2017-08-27 18:18:17.339000 - SlimShadyIAm: Core 3.0
2017-08-27 18:18:16.930000 - AbsentHiya: no
2017-08-27 18:18:15.559000 - AbsentHiya: Brady wyd
2017-08-27 18:18:10.736000 - Kyle: ^
2017-08-27 18:18:06.656000 - AbsentHiya: I'm not gonna go back to using it either
2017-08-27 18:18:05.880000 - brady: ;)
2017-08-27 18:18:03.391000 - brady: but mods can use it
2017-08-27 18:18:02.468000 - Kyle: It's being archived
2017-08-27 18:18:02.311000 - SlimShadyIAm: We can archive that
2017-08-27 18:17:58.408000 - AbsentHiya: we don't use it
2017-08-27 18:17:56.039000 - Kyle: Which is NEVER used.
2017-08-27 18:17:54.573000 - brady: this is the chat where we are making stuff
2017-08-27 18:17:47.711000 - brady: but theres also a staff chat on the other server
2017-08-27 18:17:29.404000 - Kyle: This is staff chat
2017-08-27 18:17:26.399000 - Kyle: Mods are staff
2017-08-27 18:17:22.095000 - AbsentHiya: here is 10 cents go moderate
2017-08-27 18:17:21.098000 - Kyle: Whereas everyone else is *too* invested in what they made
2017-08-27 18:17:16.054000 - brady: but mods are mods
2017-08-27 18:17:04.746000 - SlimShadyIAm: Dime a dozen
2017-08-27 18:17:04.215000 - Kyle: See, moderators can give a sort of outsiders perspective to the development process
2017-08-27 18:17:01.485000 - brady: and they dont make anything
2017-08-27 18:17:00.766000 - SlimShadyIAm: Mods are expendable lol
2017-08-27 18:16:46.424000 - brady: mods can be temporary
2017-08-27 18:16:35.674000 - reynn: don't <@!190864079634694144>
2017-08-27 18:16:35.127000 - brady: yeah but
2017-08-27 18:16:30.088000 - AbsentHiya: way to disclude Kyle yes
2017-08-27 18:16:25.612000 - qloo: i would volunteer to be a discord mod since i have a bunch of experience but like, i'm not sure if i can juggle both creative stuff and moderating lmao
2017-08-27 18:16:20.871000 - reynn: i said we need discord moderators, there are people who will do ingame and modcp
2017-08-27 18:16:19.948000 - Kyle: If I may make an argument for mods being able to see progress
2017-08-27 18:16:04.674000 - reynn: they don't
2017-08-27 18:16:03.384000 - brady: so
2017-08-27 18:15:52.420000 - brady: i feel like mods dont need access to the actual game development
2017-08-27 18:15:47.879000 - AbsentHiya: ya got the two most active "moderators" true mods or not saying 1 is enough
2017-08-27 18:15:20.089000 - Kyle: I think one is enough
2017-08-27 18:15:07.648000 - AbsentHiya: we aren't getting two I'm gonna disagree till we don't decide on two
2017-08-27 18:14:57.156000 - Kyle: I see how it is alej
2017-08-27 18:14:51.448000 - brady: it doesnt mtter

2017-08-27 18:13:25.769000 - AbsentHiya: "rare told me to ask about a creative team role"
2017-08-27 18:13:20.135000 - SlimShadyIAm: Because of inactivity
2017-08-27 18:13:16.542000 - SlimShadyIAm: <@191661929905913856> we're going to replace rare and Alex probably
2017-08-27 18:13:15.192000 - AbsentHiya: yes it was basically that for me

2017-08-27 18:12:29.559000 - SlimShadyIAm: He wanted some other role on the side so we gave him mod
2017-08-27 18:12:27.352000 - AbsentHiya: yes because rare pays for the servers
2017-08-27 18:12:22.312000 - Kyle: I'm doing that now actually alej
2017-08-27 18:12:21.165000 - SlimShadyIAm: He used to be a server funder
