2017-09-04 23:46:20.329000 - Kyle: Maybe have a big jellybean in the middle with little jellybeans surrounding it
2017-09-04 20:49:13.629000 - reynn: in b4 camp forest end
2017-09-04 20:48:57.332000 - reynn: <@200018553653428225> maybe make something like a totem?
2017-09-04 20:25:28.196000 - Spencer: we could use something like the banner but instead of america-themed have it be toontown-themed
2017-09-04 20:25:08.323000 - Spencer: also this banner
2017-09-04 20:24:48.044000 - Spencer: we might want it remade for FE
2017-09-04 20:24:36.859000 - Spencer: this is a pike fence in frontierland in disneyland CA
2017-09-04 20:24:18.052000 - Spencer: 
2017-09-03 07:03:58.111000 - brady: but not in the playground
2017-09-03 07:03:50.826000 - brady: maybe for a trolley game
2017-09-03 07:03:25.808000 - brady: animating a toon animation for cutting it down
2017-09-03 07:03:15.026000 - brady: modeling and animating a tree
2017-09-03 07:03:04.260000 - brady: think of how much more work that would be
2017-09-03 06:34:38.088000 - AbsentHiya: i like tree cutting idea
2017-09-02 19:59:33.405000 - brady: we still have to make the actual playground model
2017-09-02 19:59:19.580000 - brady: just leave it as is
2017-09-02 19:59:08.213000 - brady: or maybe no trees being cut down
2017-09-02 19:59:06.899000 - Kyle: Use the same mechanic for tug of war
2017-09-02 19:58:58.808000 - Kyle: Maybe more
2017-09-02 19:58:52.478000 - Kyle: Every tree you cut down gives 10 beans
2017-09-02 19:58:42.147000 - Kyle: Yes
2017-09-02 19:58:36.224000 - brady: how bout nothing to complicated
2017-09-02 19:58:13.145000 - Kyle: And shop lumberjack puns
2017-09-02 19:58:07.049000 - Kyle: And woodcutting
2017-09-02 19:58:02.840000 - Kyle: But forest
2017-09-02 19:57:41.786000 - SpectrumW: Why not shake bean trees, instead.
2017-09-02 19:53:40.534000 - brady: how would you like it we cut down kyles for beans
2017-09-02 19:51:37.387000 - qloo: bad message for kids
2017-09-02 19:51:34.416000 - qloo: you're killing the ENVIRONMENT
2017-09-02 19:49:50.584000 - Kyle: How about cutting down trees for beans in FE yes
2017-09-02 19:15:52.218000 - brady: also what about a bouncing effect in DDL and skating in the Brrrgh
2017-09-02 06:06:20.739000 - Disyer: <@191661929905913856> yeah
2017-09-01 04:26:05.158000 - brady: hey disyer
would it be possible to make a new kind of battle cell
one that would accommodate a new type of battle
same toon interface and shit
but like
one cog vs 8
4 on each side and it would work like a normal battle inside the battle for toons
with turns and shit
each set of 4 would choose gags and attack at the same time
and the timer would wait for the other side(edited)
and the cog attacks everyone one side at a time
but the cog has a ton of health
after the cog looses 1/4 of its health the round is over and the toons are unbounded to the cell
then the cog attacks and does some random stuff for a while
and goes to another cell
where 8 more toons can fight it
then it goes on until its dead there would also be attacks such as like rockets the cog would shoot out of his back or something that would attack other toons in the area outside the battle
2017-08-28 04:01:59.305000 - brady: yeah
2017-08-28 03:56:05.572000 - Frank: Then there should be more difficulty in the rooms
2017-08-28 03:55:31.853000 - Spencer: Well Techbots are harder than other cogs objectively
2017-08-28 03:55:04.163000 - Frank: Is the cio supposed to be more difficult than the other bosses?
2017-08-28 03:54:51.147000 - Spencer: Instead of removing cog balls
2017-08-28 03:54:42.956000 - Spencer: Where your group of toons needs to kill a certain number of cogs to pass
2017-08-28 03:54:27.736000 - Spencer: Maybe a mini version of cog thief
2017-08-28 03:53:50.003000 - Spencer: But different
2017-08-28 03:53:47.009000 - Spencer: Something like the golf games in the bbhq golf courses
2017-08-28 03:53:23.931000 - Spencer: I think there should be some more puzzles
2017-08-28 03:49:34.053000 - brady: i saw the emoji movie today
2017-08-28 03:49:28.771000 - brady: fuck you
2017-08-28 03:46:09.200000 - Spencer: I would've said yes to the firewall idea but emoji movie beat you to it
2017-08-28 03:45:41.538000 - Spencer: Something that makes them less boring
2017-08-28 03:45:33.665000 - Spencer: Maybe not completely redone just some new shit that isn't in other facilities
2017-08-28 03:45:20.209000 - Spencer: Server rooms could use some work
2017-08-28 03:41:56.819000 - brady: and have puzzles like re directing wires by picking up plugs and shit
2017-08-28 03:41:37.293000 - brady: and shit
2017-08-28 03:41:35.069000 - brady: we can have obstacles like firewalls
2017-08-28 03:41:28.310000 - brady: can we redo server rooms
2017-08-28 03:39:41.302000 - Spencer: Similar to bloopers in Mario Kart
2017-08-28 03:39:29.480000 - Spencer: She could send out a 'virus' that blocks the players screen for a number of seconds instead of just damaging them
2017-08-28 03:38:46.666000 - Spencer: I came up with a new idea for a CIO attack as well
2017-08-27 22:31:55.416000 - reynn: True
2017-08-27 22:28:15.562000 - Jake S.: That's similar to your concept
2017-08-27 22:28:09.232000 - Jake S.: <@!139483077079597056> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvdqOlIpvZA
2017-08-27 21:12:33.153000 - Frank: I like that
2017-08-27 13:58:35.761000 - Spencer: it could appear in like only one or two spots per street i guess
2017-08-27 13:57:23.602000 - Spencer: 
2017-08-27 13:51:00.689000 - Spencer: for fe
2017-08-27 13:50:51.261000 - Spencer: I feel like there should be an outhouse street prop
2017-08-27 13:00:54.534000 - reynn: just a hypothetical idea but what if the cio battle was done by one group of toons opening the doors with magnets and the other group throwing water balloons inside that are obtainable from water coolers in each corner?
2017-08-27 12:27:30.742000 - Spencer: I think if this was added the notes would have to be up to your stats page to formulate, not up to the opinion of the toon
2017-08-27 06:30:17.251000 - Kyle: So people can note up to 3 things they're good at (Like Stunning the VP, Racing, Golfing, etc.)
2017-08-27 06:29:45.222000 - Kyle: Add a little "Expertise" area to the toon info drop-down thing
2017-08-27 06:29:25.879000 - Kyle: Hey here is an idea
2017-08-26 23:46:47.213000 - Spencer: Yeah so badges
2017-08-26 23:44:48.153000 - Spencer: Nice
2017-08-26 23:31:25.481000 - Disyer: or like anywhere
2017-08-26 23:31:21.591000 - Disyer: do attachflower
2017-08-26 23:31:16.163000 - Disyer: <@200018553653428225> i can
2017-08-26 19:52:53.543000 - reynn: those will be fun texturing lel
2017-08-26 19:52:39.830000 - reynn: i know right
2017-08-26 19:52:31.879000 - Spencer: those pizza wings are amazing
2017-08-26 19:51:44.158000 - Spencer: and choose both of them
2017-08-26 19:51:34.220000 - Spencer: so you could put on one of those straps entirely separate from your shirt
2017-08-26 19:51:21.018000 - Spencer: thats actually possible, the shirt model could have two overlaid textures
2017-08-26 19:50:55.387000 - reynn: instead we'd have just one with pins/badges on it
2017-08-26 19:50:50.939000 - Spencer: gotcha
2017-08-26 19:50:40.740000 - reynn: with the sellbot emblem
2017-08-26 19:50:36.657000 - reynn: there's crossed straps
2017-08-26 19:50:32.041000 - Spencer: oh
2017-08-26 19:50:26.270000 - brady: the cog crusher outfit
2017-08-26 19:50:15.937000 - Spencer: wait wdym what straps on the sellbot outfit baru
2017-08-26 19:49:59.822000 - reynn: with pins on it
2017-08-26 19:49:58.934000 - brady: CROCS BUT THEY ARE LOAN SHARKS
2017-08-26 19:49:55.792000 - reynn: kinda like you have straps on the sellbot outfit
2017-08-26 19:49:51.814000 - Spencer: i love all of this
2017-08-26 19:49:49.585000 - brady: lmao
2017-08-26 19:49:49.087000 - Spencer: aaaaaa
2017-08-26 19:49:41.186000 - SpectrumW: Have some more for now since I gotta leave the comp for a while
2017-08-26 19:49:40.968000 - reynn: i already mentioned it to <@207512164544544769> that we could make a strap
2017-08-26 19:49:23.018000 - Spencer: yes exactly
2017-08-26 19:49:03.618000 - brady: and police badges
2017-08-26 19:48:54.566000 - brady: we could have flowers on the spot too
2017-08-26 19:48:31.057000 - Spencer: like badges
2017-08-26 19:48:20.973000 - Spencer: but maybe disyer could add a new type of accessory to take up that slot
2017-08-26 19:47:40.306000 - Spencer: I was meaning to speak to disyer abt this but theres actually a node on toon bodies called 'attachflower' which is basically used when the toon uses the squirting flower gag
2017-08-26 19:46:38.483000 - Spencer: love these
2017-08-26 19:43:27.280000 - SpectrumW: Those were approved by baru
2017-08-26 19:42:55.466000 - SpectrumW: and Rain Backpack
2017-08-26 19:42:43.194000 - SpectrumW: Rainbow Cake Backpack
2017-08-26 19:42:32.641000 - SpectrumW: the Foghorn pin

2017-08-26 18:50:22.198000 - SpectrumW: Originally a hat
2017-08-26 18:38:38.297000 - Spencer: What's that one in the upper right supposed to be
2017-08-26 18:38:23.427000 - Spencer: Ooo I really like those accessories
2017-08-26 18:37:15.079000 - brady: 
2017-08-26 18:34:46.967000 - brady: 
2017-08-26 18:34:23.894000 - brady: 
2017-08-26 18:32:54.272000 - reynn: i can't tell what the first two are exactly hence the pms haha
2017-08-26 18:32:45.584000 - SpectrumW: Okie dokie
2017-08-26 18:32:22.179000 - reynn: <@207512164544544769> pm me the descriptions of these accessories
2017-08-26 18:31:55.627000 - brady: <@!139483077079597056>
2017-08-26 18:31:52.399000 - brady: cute
2017-08-26 18:30:38.710000 - SpectrumW: Drew a few accessory concepts
2017-08-26 18:30:29.190000 - SpectrumW: 
2017-08-26 15:10:03.330000 - SpectrumW: ; )
2017-08-26 15:09:52.987000 - SpectrumW: Depends on who's using that
2017-08-26 15:09:32.549000 - reynn: hmm, is the telescope trying to watch over the toons or the cogs? <@207512164544544769> 🤔
2017-08-26 15:07:46.935000 - SpectrumW: Just casually putting this here if there's some relatively minor refurbish of other playgrounds.
2017-08-26 00:18:42.221000 - Spencer: also nice
2017-08-26 00:15:55.770000 - brady: classroom
2017-08-26 00:15:47.632000 - brady: 
2017-08-25 23:48:54.911000 - brady: just put it in one of the grass patches
2017-08-25 23:48:40.739000 - brady: fuck
2017-08-25 23:48:33.864000 - Spencer: we are there right now
2017-08-25 23:48:25.853000 - brady: we will cross that bridge when we get there i guess
2017-08-25 23:48:07.865000 - brady: i really shoulda thot about that when i was making the concept
2017-08-25 23:47:52.390000 - brady: eeh
2017-08-25 23:46:49.557000 - Spencer: brady any thoughts on the toon hq placement
2017-08-25 23:46:24.829000 - brady: idk i think its fine
2017-08-25 23:46:21.774000 - Spencer: its just a setpiece to make the area less boring
2017-08-25 23:46:11.801000 - Spencer: k but why
2017-08-25 23:46:05.809000 - Spencer: uhhhhh
2017-08-25 23:46:04.536000 - AbsentHiya: we should make a bigger onw
2017-08-25 23:46:00.583000 - AbsentHiya: its too small
2017-08-25 23:45:58.081000 - AbsentHiya: the ttc gazebo should be remade
2017-08-25 23:44:11.482000 - Spencer: "the gazebo is sacred"
2017-08-25 23:44:06.052000 - Spencer: to removing the gazebo
2017-08-25 23:44:01.485000 - Spencer: id put it there but brady seems opposed
2017-08-25 23:44:00.127000 - AbsentHiya: o
2017-08-25 23:43:54.610000 - Spencer: thats the gazebo
2017-08-25 23:43:45.681000 - AbsentHiya: arent we putting it at center of pond
2017-08-25 23:43:38.644000 - AbsentHiya: what
2017-08-25 23:43:27.704000 - Spencer: or it would seem really strange
2017-08-25 23:43:21.959000 - Spencer: but then i would need something on the other side of it
2017-08-25 23:43:03.731000 - Spencer: it could go here
2017-08-25 23:43:00 - Spencer: 
2017-08-25 23:40:51.658000 - Spencer: im still not sure where ill put the hq
2017-08-25 23:40:43.453000 - Spencer: the wider layout
2017-08-25 23:40:38.868000 - Spencer: i know
2017-08-25 23:40:03.696000 - brady: but the latest one is the best
2017-08-25 23:27:16.824000 - Spencer: 
2017-08-25 23:27:04.885000 - Spencer: from brady
2017-08-21 22:35:14.047000 - Spencer: hmm
2017-08-21 22:34:52.200000 - brady: and remove mickey
2017-08-21 22:34:30.503000 - brady: well we need to add a tunnel
2017-08-21 22:34:19.372000 - Triangle (Andrew) Vance: Are we editing ttc
2017-08-21 22:34:09.602000 - brady: ttc
2017-08-21 22:34:06.874000 - brady: thats tc
2017-08-21 22:33:51.049000 - Triangle (Andrew) Vance: ??
2017-08-21 22:33:48.444000 - Triangle (Andrew) Vance: <@191661929905913856> uhh is that map acting as a central hub for each playground
2017-08-21 22:18:40.187000 - brady: sure
2017-08-21 22:18:02.026000 - Spencer: symmetry
2017-08-21 22:17:45.968000 - Spencer: 
2017-08-21 22:10:08.752000 - brady: idk i like symmetry tho
2017-08-21 22:09:59.328000 - brady: ok
2017-08-21 22:07:56.397000 - Spencer: honestly i think there should be two more spots to fish from
2017-08-21 22:07:46.291000 - Spencer: also those ponds are a lot of wasted space imo
2017-08-21 22:06:39.011000 - Spencer: fine
2017-08-21 22:06:37.681000 - Spencer: smh
2017-08-21 22:06:33.352000 - brady: iconic
2017-08-21 22:06:30.453000 - brady: its a key feature
2017-08-21 22:05:53.031000 - brady: but people like the gazebo
2017-08-21 22:05:21.099000 - Spencer: id say just cut the gazebo and throw toon hq there
2017-08-21 22:03:07.716000 - brady: well cross that bridge when we get there
2017-08-21 22:02:59.506000 - brady: idk
2017-08-21 22:02:58.362000 - brady: shit

2017-08-20 17:45:31.733000 - Frank: Just open another pond model and study it to see how to do it
2017-08-20 17:32:54.353000 - Spencer: it could just use the data for the ddl one since the pond appears to be of similar shape
2017-08-20 17:32:38.966000 - Spencer: That's one of the main issues
2017-08-20 17:31:24.735000 - Frank: make sure the fishing pond can work too
2017-08-20 17:29:54.415000 - Spencer: thats debatable

2017-08-06 20:56:41.141000 - Spencer: Unfortunately, while I am experienced somewhat in modeling and uv mapping, I am not experienced in animation. If you find me unfit for the job, I respect that fully, but it wasn't really part of what brady was advertising for in a few different discords. YOu'll need to hire an animator...
2017-08-06 20:52:53.800000 - Frank: They will have to be animated
2017-08-06 20:44:09.053000 - Spencer: by the way, aren't the props going to be animated like the rest of the ones in the game or is there going to be a reason they don't besides it being painful to do
2017-08-06 20:42:50.011000 - Spencer: brady's
