2017-09-02 07:33:02.621000 - brady: but thats a good placeholder

2017-09-02 07:32:44.651000 - brady: just making sellbot colors and techbot more distinguishable
2017-09-02 07:32:29.279000 - brady:

2017-09-01 05:06:36.310000 - Jake S.: <@107665382277410816> triggered
2017-08-31 00:10:56.959000 - qloo: ill probably have more fun drawing the shotgun man
2017-08-30 23:43:36.974000 - Frank: me me big booy
2017-08-30 23:42:42.777000 - AbsentHiya: me me big boy?
2017-08-30 23:32:59.564000 - brady: the Big Boyo‚Ñ¢
2017-08-30 23:32:43.454000 - qloo: i wanna draw the boy‚Ñ¢
2017-08-30 23:32:30.623000 - qloo: yessss
2017-08-30 23:32:08.386000 - brady: yeah
2017-08-30 23:32:03.657000 - Spencer: Not just a boss
2017-08-30 23:32:00.722000 - Spencer: It would make sense to have a card for a regular Cog too
2017-08-30 23:31:49.838000 - brady: yea
2017-08-30 23:31:46.849000 - Spencer: Shotgun debugger is iconic yes
2017-08-30 23:31:31.564000 - brady: shotgun debugger or something
2017-08-30 23:31:17.261000 - brady: what if we did another cog
2017-08-30 23:31:11.772000 - brady: so
2017-08-30 23:31:11.014000 - brady: and itseems like the people on the art direction team agree
2017-08-30 23:31:10.421000 - Spencer: Nice
2017-08-30 23:31:06.157000 - AbsentHiya: fuck
2017-08-30 23:30:48.461000 - brady: but we shouldnt though
2017-08-30 23:30:42.782000 - Kyle: All new, actually
2017-08-30 23:30:38.506000 - Kyle: A cog, a toon, and our new playground
2017-08-30 23:30:31.726000 - Kyle: Nah, I think it should be a playground
2017-08-30 23:30:27.767000 - Spencer: 
2017-08-30 23:30:20.433000 - brady: something that isnt a playground
2017-08-30 23:30:18.629000 - Spencer: Not actual postcards
2017-08-30 23:30:13.481000 - Spencer: The old toontown cards had playground cards themed after postcards
2017-08-30 23:30:13.317000 - Kyle: 3 - I worry that if envelopes *can* fit postcards, that it will make them solid enough to where them being bent is likely
2017-08-30 23:30:09.860000 - brady: then we do another card
2017-08-30 23:29:45.374000 - Kyle: 1 - many envelopes can't fit postcards
2 - ordering custom postcards takes longer, is more expensive and confusing, and can be harder to format than trading cards, as postcards have multiple sizes where as trading cards use 16P
2017-08-30 23:28:34.405000 - Kyle: I considered adding postcards but there are issues
2017-08-30 23:28:07.896000 - Kyle: F L A V O R T E X T
2017-08-30 23:28:01.677000 - Kyle: <@!139483077079597056> put some info about the playground on the back
2017-08-30 20:20:06.509000 - Triangle (Andrew) Vance: Ok ok
2017-08-30 20:19:28.428000 - Frank: But <@279154943783337984> I'd rather not put a base building, it'll just make the process harder in the end
2017-08-30 20:19:12.346000 - Spencer: oh
2017-08-30 20:19:05.913000 - Frank: <@200018553653428225> I'm still available
2017-08-30 20:17:16.577000 - reynn: like there's nothing to put on the back of the card
2017-08-30 20:16:58.082000 - Spencer: ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
2017-08-30 20:16:51.270000 - reynn: it would make such nonsense for them to be as normal cards
2017-08-30 20:16:40.865000 - reynn: lol the playgrounds need to be done in post cards aren't i right <@200018553653428225>  <@!190864079634694144> <@191661929905913856>

2017-08-30 19:41:14.525000 - Spencer: This
2017-08-30 19:32:47.588000 - Triangle (Andrew) Vance: <@107665382277410816> I'd say build the street with dg bldgs as a base then when I finish the Fe bldgs, switch them out.
2017-08-30 19:19:55.616000 - Triangle (Andrew) Vance: Ok brb shower

2017-08-30 15:08:45.232000 - reynn: Making it a regular card would be odd
2017-08-30 15:08:34.611000 - reynn: Because we're already making the trading cards in the style of TTO
2017-08-30 15:08:12.834000 - reynn: <@!190864079634694144> tbh make it a postcard
2017-08-30 13:59:57.192000 - Sheepy: üçã <@192739415360012289> has received a lemon drop of **1** lemon! üçã
2017-08-30 13:59:57.046000 - Kyle: Regular card

2017-08-30 12:23:33.488000 - qloo: so is it best to make the Forests End card a postcard or just a regular card lmao
2017-08-30 10:55:25.565000 - reynn: I just needed to differ colors for each shape layer
2017-08-30 10:55:06.784000 - reynn: <@175594692237328384> those are not the actual colors
2017-08-30 10:21:55.666000 - Disyer: lmao
2017-08-30 10:21:55.412000 - Disyer: with a white background
2017-08-30 10:21:52.974000 - Disyer: that pink color wont fit
2017-08-30 10:21:50.832000 - Disyer: <@!139483077079597056>
2017-08-29 19:56:54.568000 - reynn: idk i'll have to see
2017-08-29 19:56:39.621000 - reynn: chocolate will make the text pop like crazy
2017-08-29 19:56:29.793000 - reynn: strawberry would make it a little bit more mellow
2017-08-29 19:55:23.881000 - SpectrumW: I like strawberry topping, but I am fine with chocolate
2017-08-29 19:53:50.806000 - Spencer: ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
2017-08-29 19:53:47.910000 - Spencer: idk

2017-08-29 19:53:16.887000 - reynn: i'm talking about the text
2017-08-29 19:53:10.964000 - reynn: the cherry will stay
2017-08-29 19:53:05.666000 - reynn: huh
2017-08-29 19:48:32.281000 - Spencer: although I'm leaning more towards the cherry
2017-08-29 19:48:17.809000 - Spencer: yeah either one could work
2017-08-29 19:46:52.751000 - qloo: i'm fine with either, but i feel a chocolate topping would give off a more "dessert-esque" vibe
2017-08-29 19:46:34.271000 - brady: choco
2017-08-29 19:46:00.405000 - qloo: hmm
2017-08-29 19:45:11.952000 - reynn: <@191661929905913856> <@200018553653428225> <@!190864079634694144> <@207512164544544769> logo opt: strawberry topping with whipped cream or chocolate topping with whipped cream
2017-08-29 19:42:32.461000 - qloo: ooo
2017-08-29 19:36:22.748000 - reynn: most likely going to play with dess because it feels too big compared to ert
2017-08-29 19:35:15.390000 - reynn:

2017-08-29 17:30:22.133000 - reynn: yeah the d was a hassle i was trying to keep it a little bit sharper
2017-08-29 17:29:55.633000 - brady: like on the D
2017-08-29 17:29:52.732000 - brady: i  would just try to make the edges more clean

He says, "hey don't mind me I'll make my own drink"

2017-08-27 17:04:43.218000 - reynn: everything else like the head and the hand is okay
2017-08-27 17:04:30.496000 - reynn: according to the body shape
2017-08-27 17:04:25.052000 - reynn: the zig zag lines will have to be changed up too
2017-08-27 17:03:46.843000 - Spencer: As long as Brady is alive
2017-08-27 17:03:41.255000 - Spencer: There would be fanfics anyway
2017-08-27 17:03:41.138000 - reynn: boobs start in the armpit
2017-08-27 17:03:38.394000 - Kyle: I N T E R E S T I N G
2017-08-27 17:03:32.627000 - reynn: also q remember to keep the line on the boob on the right, it's just anatomy <@!190864079634694144>

2017-08-27 17:03:26.281000 - Kyle: Go read the life of a mingler

2017-08-27 17:02:55.266000 - qloo: even if the cio was a guy there'd probably still be fanfics
2017-08-27 17:02:43.467000 - reynn: it's okay
2017-08-27 17:02:41.701000 - reynn: mingler is a drag
2017-08-27 17:02:36.899000 - reynn: that's okay
2017-08-27 17:02:34.586000 - Kyle: Hey have you read the life of a mingler
2017-08-27 17:02:33.834000 - reynn: the micromanager is a girl
2017-08-27 17:02:22.073000 - reynn: you can't prevent it
2017-08-27 17:02:18.738000 - reynn: there will be fanfictions of everything
2017-08-27 17:02:06.088000 - reynn: so what

2017-08-27 17:01:38.440000 - Kyle: I'm having toontown fanfic flashbacks
2017-08-27 17:01:32.175000 - Kyle: uhh, is this a good idea?
2017-08-27 17:01:25.264000 - reynn: but in a new layer
2017-08-27 17:01:21.644000 - reynn: you can try the eyelashes
2017-08-27 17:01:06.294000 - qloo: alright!
2017-08-27 17:00:48.912000 - reynn: the boob lines are to illustrate where to put shading
2017-08-27 17:00:38.277000 - reynn: the body will be enough
2017-08-27 17:00:29.720000 - reynn: 
2017-08-27 16:59:19.745000 - qloo: maybe add eyelashes too idk
2017-08-27 16:59:07.647000 - qloo: and add boob
2017-08-27 16:59:02.920000 - qloo: yeah so i could probably like make the body slimmer
2017-08-27 16:58:44.232000 - qloo: 
2017-08-27 16:58:40.822000 - reynn: i know you tend to give everything a painted vibe so i think it wouldn't be THAT hard to fix it up
2017-08-27 16:58:13.023000 - reynn: <@!190864079634694144> can you post the trading card here
2017-08-27 16:58:07.990000 - qloo: true
2017-08-27 16:57:57.249000 - reynn: ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
2017-08-27 16:57:53.605000 - reynn: technically you could just add boobs but
2017-08-27 16:57:39.748000 - Kyle: Then yeah i'd say redo the front
2017-08-27 16:57:29.736000 - reynn: the model hints at it
2017-08-27 16:57:24.281000 - reynn: it's a girl
2017-08-27 16:56:59.316000 - Kyle: Well, is the CIO going to be a guy or girl?
2017-08-27 16:55:56.882000 - qloo: should i keep the old cio drawing or just redo the front?
2017-08-27 16:53:24.660000 - qloo: (sketch in particular)
2017-08-27 16:53:17.595000 - qloo: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/339105763656073216/351203639978885133/08a71138e77abc3019b36e7c130c4f1d.png
2017-08-27 16:53:05.080000 - qloo: since the older cio card pretty much can confuse players and make them think that its a dude lol
2017-08-27 16:52:50.164000 - qloo: so brady suggested i redo the front of the CIO card to another sketch i did of her
2017-08-27 14:43:24.764000 - reynn: they're just rectangles with gradients
2017-08-27 14:43:09.958000 - reynn: yeah the planks have 0 texture so it's super easy
2017-08-27 14:42:23.204000 - Spencer: (shameless second ping)
2017-08-27 14:42:08.403000 - Spencer: building textures aren't the most complex things in the world so <@191661929905913856> should be able to texture new ones just fine
2017-08-27 14:37:55.071000 - reynn: perfect
2017-08-27 14:37:53.450000 - reynn: and the dg roof
2017-08-27 14:37:52.897000 - Spencer: right
2017-08-27 14:37:49.941000 - reynn: i can imagine the antlers there
2017-08-27 14:37:31.692000 - Spencer: those windows would be replaced with FE ones
2017-08-27 14:37:11.934000 - Spencer: and also a showcase of why im not a texture artist
2017-08-27 14:37:03.691000 - Spencer: heres a lazy recolor just to demonstrate
2017-08-27 13:04:00.633000 - reynn: of the actual houses
2017-08-27 13:03:56.113000 - reynn: and overall the shapes
2017-08-27 13:03:51.643000 - reynn: yeah
2017-08-27 13:03:30.276000 - Spencer: You mean like with Donald's Dock walls, right?
2017-08-27 13:02:38.383000 - reynn: i think we should go for dock for the actual look of the house but the rooves from daisy gardens could be used, kinda of a mix
2017-08-27 12:56:18.728000 - Spencer: thoughts?
2017-08-27 12:54:27.697000 - Spencer: 
2017-08-27 12:49:21.208000 - Spencer: in a few ways
2017-08-27 12:49:18.442000 - Spencer: this one
2017-08-27 12:49:16.602000 - Spencer: 
2017-08-27 12:49:02.495000 - Spencer: looks a lot like
2017-08-27 12:48:59.297000 - Spencer: 
2017-08-27 12:47:53.268000 - Spencer: which is the style we're going for
2017-08-27 12:47:47.543000 - Spencer: They all have roofs similar to log cabins
2017-08-27 12:47:30.114000 - Spencer: In my opinion, the buildings we should edit for Forest's End are the Daisy's Garden ones
2017-08-27 12:35:59.326000 - Spencer: And talking with Brady and Triangles about having the lamp be 2D to match with the other playgrounds
2017-08-27 12:35:32 - Spencer: Currently working on the mailbox, the trashcan, and the well
2017-08-27 06:12:12.441000 - Frank: What props are being worked on so far <@200018553653428225>
2017-08-27 06:09:06.420000 - Spencer: Yes
2017-08-27 06:09:02.853000 - reynn: so we can put fe out
2017-08-27 06:08:58.696000 - reynn: focus on the props first though
2017-08-27 06:08:48.624000 - Spencer: Ok I can model it soon
2017-08-27 06:08:41.910000 - reynn: frosting and sprinkles is just so fun
2017-08-27 06:08:33.132000 - reynn: <@200018553653428225> also i'd really like the pink cake pouch to become a thing LOL i wanna texture it so bad
2017-08-27 06:08:09.575000 - Triangle (Andrew) Vance: I am now sleeping good night
2017-08-27 06:08:04.173000 - Triangle (Andrew) Vance: Yes I need to remake
2017-08-27 06:06:50.997000 - Spencer: The one triangles made before was a fluke
2017-08-27 06:06:35.035000 - reynn: at least shape wise
2017-08-27 06:06:23.022000 - reynn: even furniture
2017-08-27 06:06:20.355000 - reynn: because every other horn/antler in the actual game is realistic
2017-08-27 06:06:18.796000 - Spencer: Well
2017-08-27 06:06:14.937000 - Spencer: Yeah
2017-08-27 06:06:11.147000 - Frank: we should also add 1-2 new ones
2017-08-27 06:06:04.181000 - reynn: can we make sure to make the antlers more realistic than just a big rectangle with sharp tips?
2017-08-27 06:05:23.826000 - Spencer: Triangles and I will change the windows and add antlers to the bldgs
2017-08-27 06:04:42.045000 - Spencer: Yes
2017-08-27 06:04:34.475000 - reynn: definitely needs a different color palette
2017-08-27 06:04:21.977000 - reynn: since they're also wooden
2017-08-27 06:04:16.475000 - reynn: i think brady should base the retextures off the ddock ones
2017-08-27 06:03:27.668000 - Spencer: Thanks
2017-08-27 06:03:24.558000 - Spencer: Nice
2017-08-27 06:01:47.931000 - Frank: everything after that is it's own
2017-08-27 06:01:10.682000 - Frank: and C buildings tend to be really tall ones
2017-08-27 06:01:02.567000 - Frank: A buildings tend to be the fat ones
2017-08-27 06:00:53.170000 - Frank: B buildings tend to be tall ones
2017-08-27 06:00:45.170000 - Frank: This has a 3rd B building
2017-08-27 06:00:38.007000 - Frank: http://prntscr.com/gdj3eg
2017-08-27 05:59:48.501000 - Frank: but it's mostly based off of TTC
2017-08-27 05:59:30.349000 - Frank: DDL has 1 special building
2017-08-27 05:59:19.327000 - Frank: http://prntscr.com/gdj352
2017-08-27 05:58:44.625000 - Spencer: Yeah a lot of these would look good retextured for FE I think
2017-08-27 05:58:21.346000 - Frank: It's all special buildings
2017-08-27 05:58:13.519000 - Frank: DG

2017-08-27 05:58:08.247000 - Frank: same with ddl
2017-08-27 05:57:26.966000 - Frank: It's an exception
2017-08-27 05:57:06.131000 - Frank: Here's DDL
2017-08-27 05:57:03.940000 - Frank: http://prntscr.com/gdj2lt
2017-08-27 05:57:01.096000 - Frank: That's just a variation of the model
2017-08-27 05:57:00.767000 - Spencer: Ah
2017-08-27 05:56:48.167000 - Frank: they also have numbers after them
2017-08-27 05:55:58.125000 - Frank: same with B's, C's. D's, and E's
2017-08-27 05:55:49.909000 - Frank: different textures
2017-08-27 05:55:46.864000 - Frank: All a's are same
2017-08-27 05:55:41.622000 - Frank: just different textures
2017-08-27 05:55:37.168000 - Frank: they are all same
2017-08-27 05:55:35.507000 - Triangle (Andrew) Vance: but tomorrow i am getting sleepy
2017-08-27 05:55:20.270000 - Frank: A's, B's, C's, D's and E's
2017-08-27 05:55:19.630000 - Triangle (Andrew) Vance: make them fe theme
2017-08-27 05:55:14.748000 - Triangle (Andrew) Vance: yes i will remake them all for fe
2017-08-27 05:54:41.645000 - Frank: Here's how the buildings work <@200018553653428225>
2017-08-27 05:54:17.708000 - Frank: mml
2017-08-27 05:54:16.661000 - Frank: http://prntscr.com/gdj235
2017-08-27 05:53:06.269000 - Spencer: Oh thanks this should me useful yeah
2017-08-27 05:52:22.588000 - Frank: http://prntscr.com/gdj1q1
2017-08-27 05:52:20.423000 - Frank: TTC
2017-08-27 05:50:42.159000 - Spencer: I wish there was an easy way to pview on mobile
2017-08-27 05:50:11.845000 - Frank: i can line them up in the level editor
2017-08-27 05:50:08.242000 - Spencer: Triangles said he would edit some
2017-08-27 05:49:58.876000 - Spencer: I'll start on that when I get the chance to comb through all the buildings in the morning
2017-08-27 05:49:52.543000 - Frank: Any ideas on some buildings already?
2017-08-27 05:49:08.779000 - Frank: Yeah
2017-08-27 05:46:49.921000 - Spencer: We need to gather a list of buildings that we plan on editing for forest's end so that Brady knows which buildings to retexture
2017-08-27 05:36:50.514000 - Spencer: That's true
2017-08-27 05:35:50.426000 - Frank: also not all buildings have cornices
2017-08-27 05:35:35.590000 - Triangle (Andrew) Vance: nvm yeah i can fix
2017-08-27 05:35:23.762000 - Triangle (Andrew) Vance: wait
2017-08-27 05:35:03.432000 - Triangle (Andrew) Vance: that's because of this <@200018553653428225>
2017-08-27 05:34:53.180000 - Triangle (Andrew) Vance: actually
2017-08-27 05:34:25.510000 - Triangle (Andrew) Vance: too
2017-08-27 05:34:24.622000 - Triangle (Andrew) Vance: oh i can fix that tii
2017-08-27 05:34:04.414000 - Spencer: The shadow goes out of the boundary of the cornice texture
2017-08-27 05:33:55.887000 - Frank: maybe color the trianges to the left of the center log black
2017-08-27 05:33:43.295000 - Spencer: Could use some tweaking as well
2017-08-27 05:33:39.133000 - Frank: i noticed that
2017-08-27 05:33:36.231000 - Frank: hmm
2017-08-27 05:33:34.263000 - Spencer: 
2017-08-27 05:33:16.297000 - Spencer: The one on the far left has a hole you can see through
2017-08-27 05:33:10.888000 - Frank: i cant
2017-08-27 05:33:02.452000 - Triangle (Andrew) Vance: i think frank can do that in level editor
2017-08-27 05:32:19.612000 - brady: like two of the same texture side by side
2017-08-27 05:32:12.514000 - brady: can you make the middle one like double the texture
2017-08-27 05:32:01.496000 - Frank: other than that it's fine
2017-08-27 05:32:00.090000 - brady: the middle one
2017-08-27 05:31:59.649000 - Triangle (Andrew) Vance: i am back
2017-08-27 05:31:58.341000 - Triangle (Andrew) Vance: i am out of my "eh ill do it later!!!!" phase
2017-08-27 05:31:55.422000 - Frank: the one in the middle should be fixed
2017-08-27 05:31:48.130000 - Triangle (Andrew) Vance: brady
2017-08-27 05:31:46.202000 - Triangle (Andrew) Vance: that is fine
2017-08-27 05:31:39.414000 - brady: ill need to make better ones
2017-08-27 05:31:31.035000 - brady: eh
2017-08-27 05:31:25.785000 - Frank: but the other 2 look good
2017-08-27 05:31:22.274000 - Frank: so the one in the middle look a bit ugly
2017-08-27 05:31:14.387000 - Frank: http://prntscr.com/gdixfg

2017-08-27 04:40:43.368000 - Spencer: Like most hqs
2017-08-27 04:40:38.596000 - Spencer: Like it's a simple building with a large hat on it
2017-08-27 04:40:25.136000 - Spencer: The have model, now that I'm looking at it, seems pretty straightforward
2017-08-27 04:40:05.052000 - Triangle (Andrew) Vance: but i pushed it off forever
2017-08-27 04:39:59.094000 - Triangle (Andrew) Vance: such a little amount of time

2017-08-27 04:39:19.004000 - Triangle (Andrew) Vance: "working" being waiting until everyone is pissed about triangles not working
2017-08-27 04:38:58.148000 - Spencer: I think triangles is "working" on the hq
2017-08-27 04:38:29.986000 - Frank: we can make it our own building-styled prop
2017-08-27 04:38:23.879000 - Frank: instead of the side being infront of flatbuildings
2017-08-27 04:38:10.316000 - Frank: where it's like a building, but like diner
2017-08-27 04:38:07.475000 - Spencer: 
2017-08-27 04:37:53.878000 - Frank: we could have a side building model

2017-08-27 04:33:40.622000 - Frank: yeah
2017-08-27 04:33:39.756000 - Spencer: They also need to be modified to use FE window textures
2017-08-27 04:32:37.723000 - Spencer: Like to add the antlers to them
2017-08-27 04:32:26.633000 - Spencer: Yes I wouldn't be opposed to modifying a couple
2017-08-27 04:26:50.654000 - Triangle (Andrew) Vance: yes

2017-08-27 04:22:56.906000 - Spencer: Lots of options that would get this done both sooner and more authentic/true to the original game
2017-08-27 04:22:12.158000 - Triangle (Andrew) Vance: or whatever
2017-08-27 04:21:57.988000 - Triangle (Andrew) Vance: use the cutout around it for the walls as a base

2017-08-27 04:21:44.833000 - Triangle (Andrew) Vance: yea i was gonna just edit one of the bldgs and give it fe themes

2017-08-27 04:21:19.347000 - Spencer: 
2017-08-27 04:16:52.028000 - Spencer: I mean i could give some of them some placeholder textures until another team member has the time to make final versions
2017-08-27 04:12:04.931000 - Spencer: Oh
2017-08-27 04:11:40.091000 - Triangle (Andrew) Vance: i meant change the textures..

2017-08-27 04:10:26.656000 - Spencer: This building could be retextured
2017-08-27 04:10:12.540000 - Spencer:

2017-08-26 23:11:21.918000 - Frank: on the windows.bam model, the pallette for the new FE windows needs to be added
2017-08-26 23:10:57.744000 - Triangle (Andrew) Vance: oh do i need to rename the nodes
2017-08-26 23:10:48.616000 - Triangle (Andrew) Vance: like the same windows from ttc or ?
2017-08-26 23:10:21.471000 - Frank: Are these models the same but with the forest end windows

2017-08-26 22:59:54.550000 - Spencer: <@191661929905913856>
2017-08-26 22:59:51.605000 - Spencer: I think Brady should make some new sign textures too
2017-08-26 22:59:40.186000 - Frank: Just add the pallettes and the nodes to the models
2017-08-26 22:59:11.639000 - Spencer: The cornices also need to be done
2017-08-26 22:58:17.647000 - Triangle (Andrew) Vance: I will finish those asap
2017-08-26 22:58:13.282000 - Triangle (Andrew) Vance: You need the walls as well

2017-08-26 18:35:25.933000 - reynn: all cool
2017-08-26 18:35:21.314000 - qloo: thank you for helping with that, haha

2017-08-26 18:35:14.344000 - qloo: OOO
2017-08-26 18:35:08.208000 - reynn: Skipper McHop is a speedy bunny who likes to hang out near the Toon Hall. Watch out though, as his tricks could send you over to different playgrounds!
2017-08-26 18:34:54.713000 - qloo: gonna send you to hell dood
2017-08-26 18:34:20.977000 - Jake S.: xd
2017-08-26 18:33:52.795000 - AbsentHiya: "if you don't like ttc he will send you ELSEWHERE...."
2017-08-26 18:33:45.776000 - qloo: LMAO
2017-08-26 18:33:39.746000 - AbsentHiya: LOL
2017-08-26 18:33:38.427000 - AbsentHiya: he sounds like a murderer
2017-08-26 18:33:36.140000 - reynn: we need to reword that one
2017-08-26 18:33:34.217000 - qloo: ah yea
2017-08-26 18:33:26.993000 - reynn: the second sentence is negative
2017-08-26 18:33:23.951000 - qloo: probably gonna add daisy gardens + donalds dock signs on the side
2017-08-26 18:33:09.192000 - qloo: im awful at descriptions oofie...
2017-08-26 18:12:04.271000 - AbsentHiya: i didn't ping u once there
2017-08-26 18:11:43.431000 - Spencer: for no reason
2017-08-26 18:11:40.121000 - Spencer: pinged me in the ttr discord
2017-08-26 18:11:22.509000 - AbsentHiya: ??
2017-08-26 18:08:41.963000 - Spencer: nice ping <@!211862557726605313>
2017-08-26 17:55:39.879000 - Spencer: The well would still be modeled from scratch however
2017-08-26 17:54:16.635000 - Spencer: the prop concept art already looks considerably like other props
2017-08-26 17:52:52.035000 - Spencer: I'm still unsure about the props, I think it would be best quality-wise if we edited existing props that already have animations, otherwise we're stuck with new props with either low-quality of no animation
2017-08-26 17:52:13.193000 - reynn: idk
2017-08-26 17:52:11.906000 - reynn: that's why i wanted to make an actual list in update queue and urge everyone to give feedback
2017-08-26 17:51:44.402000 - Kyle: Disyer is *terrible* at communication
2017-08-26 17:51:19.484000 - reynn: <@200018553653428225> could've worked on the props instead of ttc had he known that disyer doesn't want it
2017-08-26 17:50:48.203000 - reynn: idk it's still time that could've been used on something else
2017-08-26 17:50:18.078000 - reynn: i just feel like that's something we could avoid in the future
2017-08-26 17:50:07.893000 - reynn: because <@175594692237328384> absolutely didn't know and suddenly he just cut it off even though we started working on it
2017-08-26 17:50:05.491000 - brady: i mean we should like it
2017-08-26 17:50:00.903000 - brady: well
2017-08-26 17:49:50.531000 - brady: it matters if the people playing the game like it
2017-08-26 17:49:41.670000 - brady: tbh it doesnt matter if we like what we are making
2017-08-26 17:49:37.227000 - reynn: but there's clearly not enough communication
2017-08-26 17:49:24.177000 - reynn: and we might talk about it in general or somewhere
2017-08-26 17:49:14.303000 - reynn: we start making stuff
2017-08-26 17:49:09.308000 - reynn: my point is
2017-08-26 17:48:28.574000 - reynn: just like yesterday when we couldn't decide what would our new logo be
2017-08-26 17:48:13.647000 - reynn: <@!211862557726605313> there's always gonna be division
2017-08-26 17:47:56.066000 - brady: ok
2017-08-26 17:47:49.364000 - reynn: in update queue
2017-08-26 17:47:47.208000 - reynn: i posted an example
2017-08-26 17:47:42.720000 - reynn: here
2017-08-26 17:47:17.320000 - Spencer: thats a good point
2017-08-26 17:47:01.338000 - AbsentHiya: we need compromise
2017-08-26 17:46:58.006000 - AbsentHiya: we don't need division
2017-08-26 17:46:54.485000 - AbsentHiya: voting causes division
2017-08-26 17:46:41.989000 - qloo: ^^
2017-08-26 17:46:30.006000 - reynn: and vote yes/no on every thing on the list
2017-08-26 17:46:11.648000 - reynn: in the update queue
2017-08-26 17:46:06.829000 - reynn: make an actual plan
2017-08-26 17:46:02.652000 - reynn: can we like
2017-08-26 17:46:00.250000 - reynn: okay guys
2017-08-26 17:45:44.855000 - AbsentHiya: one day I just see ttc concepts I'm like "oh ok I guess we are doing this now"
2017-08-26 17:45:30.002000 - AbsentHiya: I don't even understand why we are doing half the shit we are doing
2017-08-26 17:45:15.853000 - AbsentHiya: Brady remodelling ttc isnt gonna get us anything
2017-08-26 17:43:39.528000 - reynn: ensure that cio won't be halfbaked
2017-08-26 17:43:31.878000 - reynn: let's just
2017-08-26 17:43:29.324000 - reynn: guys just wait until cio
2017-08-26 17:04:59.636000 - brady: "they must have put a lot of hard work into this"
2017-08-26 17:04:47.613000 - brady: i want people to say "wow... thats actually cool"
2017-08-26 17:04:23.373000 - brady: we are already known in the community for "half-baked" content
2017-08-26 17:03:33.459000 - brady: and people would enjoy it
2017-08-26 17:03:29.775000 - brady: but its something new
2017-08-26 17:03:26.684000 - brady: it has similar mechanics as ttr doomsday
2017-08-26 17:03:02.008000 - brady: the invasion idea is something way different
2017-08-26 17:02:55.319000 - Disyer: if thats what you want to accomplish
2017-08-26 17:02:48.728000 - Disyer: none, it was already done
2017-08-26 17:02:45.774000 - Disyer: wheres the wow effect
2017-08-26 17:02:43.523000 - Disyer: we'd just be remaking them
2017-08-26 17:02:40.441000 - Disyer: we cant live on these ideas all day, other people have already made these
2017-08-26 17:02:26.833000 - Disyer: thats what it is
2017-08-26 17:02:25.340000 - Disyer: "lets remake ttr's doomsday"
2017-08-26 17:02:19.958000 - Disyer: its the same thing
2017-08-26 17:02:18.307000 - Disyer: your invasion idea
2017-08-26 17:02:17.206000 - Jake S.: yes it is
2017-08-26 17:02:14.392000 - Disyer: thats like
2017-08-26 17:02:12.833000 - brady: its not a beta ttc ripoff
2017-08-26 17:02:06.387000 - Spencer: oof
2017-08-26 17:02:02.882000 - Disyer: a fucking beta ttc ripoff is not *grand*
2017-08-26 17:01:56.046000 - Disyer: remaking ttc is not the way to show that
2017-08-26 17:01:54.744000 - brady: something _grand_
2017-08-26 17:01:44.820000 - brady: we need to show the community that we are capable of making _good_ new content
2017-08-26 17:01:25.552000 - brady: but honestly
2017-08-26 17:01:12.914000 - Jake S.: we can just say its a dick and move on
2017-08-26 17:01:05.974000 - Disyer: it doesnt matter
2017-08-26 17:01:04.897000 - Disyer: who cares about it being shaped as mickey
2017-08-26 17:01:00.996000 - Disyer: no new design could match the current quality of the playground
2017-08-26 17:00:53.917000 - brady: because its shaped like mickey
2017-08-26 17:00:29.357000 - Disyer: <@191661929905913856> why do you want to remake the perfectly fine ttc playground?
2017-08-26 16:56:51.952000 - brady: <@175594692237328384> cmon

2017-08-26 03:05:31.671000 - Spencer: To emphasize it more
2017-08-26 03:05:21.723000 - Spencer: I think I'm gonna make an indent out of the oval for Toon Hall to go into
2017-08-26 02:58:43.640000 - Spencer: i think you get the idea
2017-08-26 02:58:39.066000 - Spencer: the uv map for the grass is pretty simple
2017-08-26 02:58:29.380000 - Spencer: 
2017-08-26 02:54:53.459000 - Spencer: since im not as used to ones besides barrier
2017-08-26 02:54:45.666000 - Spencer: i might need help from triangles on collisions
2017-08-26 02:52:58.280000 - Spencer: and also some things from the beta playground
2017-08-26 02:52:45.510000 - Spencer: yeah this is based on the oval
2017-08-26 02:52:43.776000 - Spencer:

2017-08-26 02:51:31.646000 - Spencer: -a new water texture (the original ttc one is too small and the dd one looks like shit
2017-08-26 02:51:13.649000 - Spencer: -a new end of fence texture as shown above
2017-08-26 02:51:02.479000 - Spencer: -a new grass shadow texture
2017-08-26 02:50:50.656000 - Spencer: textures i need

2017-08-26 00:50:38.217000 - Spencer: yeah
2017-08-26 00:48:00.360000 - brady: can ya make a placeholder
2017-08-26 00:27:41.123000 - Spencer: im probably gonna need a revised ttc ground layout texture
2017-08-26 00:18:38.848000 - Spencer: 
2017-08-25 21:11:44.131000 - Jake S.: xd

2017-08-25 21:09:02.321000 - Spencer: not a toony one though, it should have a new model and texture for the wizard hat
2017-08-25 21:08:45.973000 - Spencer: ^
2017-08-25 21:08:42.867000 - Stormish: it would make more sense if the wizard wore a wizard hat
2017-08-25 21:08:24.633000 - Spencer: agreed
2017-08-25 21:08:17.912000 - Stormish: yes

2017-08-25 20:41:01.156000 - brady: maybe
2017-08-25 20:40:42.175000 - Spencer: Maybe it could have one of the bbhq trees in the pot
2017-08-25 20:40:18.714000 - Spencer: Yes the flower pot one would be nice
2017-08-25 20:40:13.163000 - brady: the we can call it a pothead

2017-08-25 18:58:49.674000 - Triangle (Andrew) Vance: 
2017-08-25 18:58:28.507000 - qloo: ok
2017-08-25 18:58:07.890000 - Jake S.: just go give it boobs
2017-08-25 18:57:46.877000 - qloo: i would have drawn her differently on the card
2017-08-25 18:57:41.487000 - qloo: but yeah why didnt anyone tell me that the cio was a girl oof
2017-08-25 18:57:25.476000 - Triangle (Andrew) Vance: sad
2017-08-25 18:57:20.335000 - qloo: 14 years iirc
2017-08-25 18:57:20.243000 - Triangle (Andrew) Vance: Not 15 years
2017-08-25 18:56:58.864000 - Triangle (Andrew) Vance: how long has toontown been out for
2017-08-25 18:56:51.684000 - Triangle (Andrew) Vance: Building on 15 years of success, the CIO Conference returns to provide business and technology leaders with a platform to learn, share and debate the key challenges and opportunities of new technologies and ways of doing business.
2017-08-25 18:56:38.576000 - Triangle (Andrew) Vance: yes
2017-08-25 18:56:36.900000 - Triangle (Andrew) Vance: https://www.cio-asia.com/microsites/cio/cio-conference-singapore-2017/
2017-08-25 18:55:34.270000 - Spencer: I would edit the body myself but I don't know anything about egg-optchar
2017-08-25 18:54:06.707000 - Spencer: But yes make the head from scratch, edit the body, and change the legs
2017-08-25 18:53:56.496000 - qloo: oooo
2017-08-25 18:53:55.761000 - qloo: wait shes female???
2017-08-25 18:53:47.886000 - Spencer: I'm probably wrong tho
2017-08-25 18:53:39.475000 - Spencer: I thought the body was part of the legs model
2017-08-25 18:53:13.261000 - Jake S.: interesting lmao
2017-08-25 18:53:09.786000 - Triangle (Andrew) Vance: ya!!
2017-08-25 18:53:05.149000 - Jake S.: is the CIO female
2017-08-25 18:53:03.309000 - Triangle (Andrew) Vance: and have existing anims
2017-08-25 18:52:57.148000 - Triangle (Andrew) Vance: We could just edit the head+body
2017-08-25 18:52:45.800000 - Triangle (Andrew) Vance: The legs, head, and the body are completely separate models iirc
2017-08-25 18:48:02.640000 - Spencer: For the sake of not having to make new animations, you might want to opt for Stormish to edit the existing cog boss body
2017-08-25 18:47:23.693000 - Spencer: I saw one of the preliminary models for them which was made (I assume) from scratch
2017-08-25 18:46:56.662000 - Spencer: Speaking of the CIO
2017-08-25 08:24:50.737000 - brady: 
2017-08-25 04:40:26.315000 - brady: ok cool
2017-08-25 04:40:18.693000 - reynn: I'm gonna think of more but I have a meeting today regarding part time job as a graphic designer so I won't get to work on it until after then
2017-08-25 04:39:59.297000 - brady: i would leave out the tornado
2017-08-25 04:39:25.302000 - reynn: Yeah
2017-08-25 04:39:24.341000 - brady: or
2017-08-25 04:39:23.994000 - reynn: But that's just an idea that popped into my head
2017-08-25 04:39:22.020000 - brady: the logo?
2017-08-25 04:39:11.457000 - reynn: A big tornado with gags flying in it and inside operation dessert storm
2017-08-25 04:38:46.777000 - reynn: I was thinking
2017-08-25 04:37:26.163000 - brady: ik
2017-08-25 04:37:22.720000 - reynn: Brady it's really late lol

2017-08-25 04:37:01.172000 - reynn: Toontown Storm makes no sense
2017-08-25 04:36:52.476000 - reynn: No
2017-08-25 04:36:46.167000 - reynn: Cio?
2017-08-25 04:36:42.877000 - brady: 
2017-08-25 04:36:32.570000 - AbsentHiya: we can make operation dessert storm a thing like operation duck hunt
2017-08-25 04:36:15.417000 - reynn: We can give it a meaning though
2017-08-25 04:36:06.684000 - reynn: I don't think we can change it
2017-08-25 04:36:01.683000 - brady: i guess the name makes sense if you just say its the name of the war
2017-08-25 04:35:58.422000 - reynn: I think it could be toony though if we make it toony
2017-08-25 04:35:45.212000 - AbsentHiya: I don't get it either
2017-08-25 04:35:42.904000 - brady: im being logical and reasonable here

2017-08-25 04:35:11.063000 - AbsentHiya: Brady u went from
2017-08-25 04:35:06.027000 - reynn: I know lol I guess it's just the fact it's a war
2017-08-25 04:34:36.078000 - brady: what does it have to do with our game
2017-08-25 04:34:30.121000 - brady: but like

2017-08-25 04:33:20.907000 - brady: no meaning
2017-08-25 04:33:15.904000 - brady: but there really is no point to the name
2017-08-25 04:33:04.444000 - reynn: Everyone already knows us by ods
2017-08-25 04:32:44.658000 - brady: thats also kinda late
2017-08-25 04:32:36.810000 - brady: but like
2017-08-25 04:32:22.875000 - brady: i feel like we should come up with a new name
2017-08-25 04:32:21.739000 - reynn: ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
2017-08-25 04:32:13.302000 - brady: no one really knows tho
2017-08-25 04:32:01.919000 - reynn: And make it toony
2017-08-25 04:31:56.936000 - reynn: I think I'd prefer to keep it stray from the pun if I was to make to logo
2017-08-25 04:31:28.469000 - brady: why is it Operation: Dessert Storm
2017-08-25 04:31:09.374000 - brady: whats its significance
2017-08-25 04:31:04.659000 - brady: the title
2017-08-25 04:31:02.616000 - brady: the name

2017-08-25 04:30:55.288000 - reynn: Yeah I'll think of something then haha
2017-08-25 04:30:27.769000 - brady: but it is necessary
2017-08-25 04:30:19.447000 - brady: ok nice
2017-08-25 04:30:14.867000 - reynn: But Mike said it's unnecessary
2017-08-25 04:30:01.872000 - reynn: I said I could do it when Jake asked me
2017-08-25 04:29:45.573000 - reynn: We already brought it up
2017-08-25 03:23:20.950000 - brady: we should also make a better looking logo
2017-08-25 01:20:57.014000 - qloo: (rest of card is blank)
2017-08-25 01:20:44.082000 - qloo: probably gonna hold work on the CIO card since like there isnt solid info about what the battle mechanic / story is

2017-08-23 18:10:34.260000 - reynn: <@!190864079634694144>
2017-08-23 18:10:32.313000 - reynn: 
2017-08-23 18:08:42.633000 - reynn: yeah it's just common for trading cards to tell you that
2017-08-23 18:08:15.974000 - qloo: i set up the layout, but i wasnt sure what to put on it lmaoo
2017-08-23 18:08:07.273000 - reynn: something like that
2017-08-23 18:08:07.211000 - qloo: ah ok!
2017-08-23 18:07:57.050000 - reynn: likes numbers
2017-08-23 18:07:51.865000 - reynn: likes oil
2017-08-23 18:07:44.712000 - reynn: eg dislilkes water as in spills
2017-08-23 18:07:35.644000 - reynn: and you should come up with some things it likes/dislikes
2017-08-23 18:07:24.295000 - reynn: somebody should make you a short story
2017-08-23 18:06:22.165000 - qloo: quick question, what should i do for the back of the card?
2017-08-23 15:19:50.119000 - Kyle: Spicie memeball
2017-08-23 14:38:31.949000 - qloo: üëÅ
2017-08-23 14:09:27.537000 - brady: trash can on far right
2017-08-23 14:09:21.151000 - brady: 
2017-08-23 08:06:39.013000 - reynn: ok
2017-08-23 08:06:28.855000 - brady: but im gonna try to sleep now since i got schools
2017-08-23 08:06:16.250000 - brady: you can take a break if ya want or whatever
2017-08-23 08:05:56.921000 - brady: thanks
2017-08-23 08:05:49.631000 - brady: ok nice
2017-08-23 08:05:30.067000 - reynn: <@191661929905913856>
2017-08-23 08:05:26.048000 - reynn: 
2017-08-23 08:05:25.746000 - reynn: 
2017-08-23 07:49:48.979000 - reynn: oki
2017-08-23 07:49:35.418000 - brady: without would be better
2017-08-23 07:49:01.404000 - reynn: <@191661929905913856>
2017-08-23 07:48:57.865000 - reynn: with/without
2017-08-23 07:48:54.572000 - reynn: but you tell me what you'd like more
2017-08-23 07:48:47.750000 - reynn: (just a shape sketch)
2017-08-23 07:48:43.288000 - reynn: (don't mind the snow outline on the closest mountain, i'll fix that) i thought since it's forest end we could add like a forest on the mountains
2017-08-23 07:42:47.909000 - brady: you can just make a black and white png of it and i can export it as an rgb later
2017-08-23 07:42:27.205000 - brady: but whatever you want
2017-08-23 07:42:13.763000 - reynn: i know gimp usually borks the rgb
2017-08-23 07:42:12.035000 - brady: i actually might have 2015
2017-08-23 07:42:04.972000 - reynn: ill get the plugin then
2017-08-23 07:42:04.876000 - brady: hm
2017-08-23 07:41:59.704000 - reynn: really? i think it didnt work on 2015 which is why i was so skeptical
2017-08-23 07:41:42.808000 - brady: so
2017-08-23 07:41:39.706000 - brady: but i use 2017 cc and i have the plugin and it works fine for me
2017-08-23 07:41:19.076000 - brady: it doesnt matter what you use
2017-08-23 07:40:55.003000 - reynn: because i have cc 2017 so i don't think it'll work on my version, i'd have to install an older one
2017-08-23 07:40:28.589000 - reynn: hmm, how do you prefer rgbs? gimp or the photoshop plugin?
2017-08-23 07:39:36.299000 - brady: now you just have to add the background stitching and export an rgb of it
2017-08-23 07:39:04.790000 - brady: ok nice
2017-08-23 07:38:39.986000 - reynn: because they all have cold tones
2017-08-23 07:38:32.970000 - reynn: since the blue is set on multiply it really doesn't affect the other mountains
2017-08-23 07:38:12.030000 - reynn: fixed all of them
2017-08-23 07:38:07.828000 - reynn: 
2017-08-23 07:36:25.588000 - brady: its only noticeable on the close mountain
2017-08-23 07:35:32.739000 - reynn: 1 sec
2017-08-23 07:35:29.302000 - reynn: ah yeah that's because i have the snow clipped to the mountain
2017-08-23 07:35:25.806000 - AbsentHiya: hey I love that
2017-08-23 07:34:43.748000 - brady: could ya try to make the border shading on the snow match that
2017-08-23 07:34:09.105000 - brady: you see the shading difference on the snow though and how the bottom of the snow lumps is tinted blue
2017-08-23 07:32:21.358000 - brady: i like that
2017-08-23 07:32:08.219000 - brady: yeah
2017-08-23 07:31:41.902000 - reynn: 
2017-08-23 07:30:07.320000 - brady: maybe making the closest mountains less gray
2017-08-23 07:28:13.347000 - reynn: yup on it
2017-08-23 07:27:44.883000 - brady: there just needs more contrast between the mountains
2017-08-23 07:27:00.515000 - brady: ok
2017-08-23 07:26:58.190000 - brady: yeah
2017-08-23 07:26:56.320000 - reynn: 
2017-08-23 07:25:52.195000 - reynn: but yeah would be odd if that one had such thick outlines while the background was just.. yeah
2017-08-23 07:25:32.096000 - reynn: idk if the tree backdrop is gonna be used or not
2017-08-23 07:25:24.128000 - reynn: i'm basing everything off the zip honestly
2017-08-23 07:23:56.783000 - brady: lmao
2017-08-23 07:23:55.660000 - brady: dont put the outline on the trees either
2017-08-23 07:23:33.165000 - reynn: yeah i thought i'd add the outline because of the trees
2017-08-23 07:23:29.645000 - brady: i think it would look better without the outline
2017-08-23 07:23:12.075000 - brady: and could you also try removing the outline for the mountain one
2017-08-23 07:23:06.562000 - reynn: okay üòù
2017-08-23 07:22:24.213000 - brady: kinda similar to the ttr toonfest tree
2017-08-23 07:22:13.415000 - brady: instead of leaves
2017-08-23 07:22:09.647000 - brady: so for that do little needles
2017-08-23 07:21:47.083000 - reynn: ah yeah
2017-08-23 07:21:32.162000 - brady: you know what i mean?
2017-08-23 07:21:24.872000 - brady: it has those monotone leaf cutouts scattered about
2017-08-23 07:21:07.635000 - brady: if you look at the ttc trees and such
2017-08-23 07:21:00.942000 - brady: dont make it too similar though
2017-08-23 07:20:52.478000 - brady: pine/ fur trees
2017-08-23 07:20:43.710000 - brady: so
2017-08-23 07:20:33.477000 - reynn: i was gonna make something like miniature version of these
2017-08-23 07:19:59.058000 - reynn: to create an equal shading everywhere
2017-08-23 07:19:57.421000 - brady: for the trees you know how it has that leaf pattern randomly scattered on it
2017-08-23 07:19:50.890000 - reynn: yeah i decided i would mix sai (in which i make raster) with photoshop and used layer effects for all the shading
2017-08-23 07:19:32.233000 - brady: keep it up
2017-08-23 07:19:04.878000 - brady: lookin slick
2017-08-23 07:18:37.005000 - reynn: <@191661929905913856> so far. gonna try to make the forest now!
2017-08-21 13:37:14.013000 - brady: ill remaster the texture later
2017-08-21 13:37:07.036000 - brady: nice
2017-08-21 13:23:18.269000 - Stormish: now for the ears
2017-08-21 13:23:14.953000 - Stormish: 
2017-08-21 13:22:57.900000 - Stormish: 
2017-08-21 13:20:31.623000 - Stormish: 
2017-08-21 13:20:16.480000 - Stormish: 
2017-08-21 10:27:44.640000 - Stormish: <@191661929905913856> Sure
2017-08-21 01:09:09.562000 - brady: or whichever one
2017-08-21 01:09:04.087000 - brady: theres a blue variation for software simian
2017-08-21 01:08:53.147000 - Spencer: i see the resemblance now
2017-08-21 01:08:52.506000 - brady: shouldnt be hard to add ears
2017-08-21 01:08:41.269000 - Spencer: ah
2017-08-21 01:08:29.777000 - brady: i just made it off of the gerrymander tex
2017-08-21 01:08:19.379000 - Spencer: k
2017-08-21 01:08:17.305000 - brady: idk
2017-08-21 01:08:15.506000 - brady: lmao
2017-08-21 01:08:11.382000 - brady: doesnt matter
2017-08-21 01:07:47.144000 - Spencer: is that a quirk in the uv map of the head or
2017-08-21 01:07:33.542000 - Spencer: although whats with the inconsistency here
2017-08-21 01:07:26.525000 - Spencer: 
2017-08-21 01:06:58.772000 - Spencer: this looks pretty nice
2017-08-21 01:03:27.641000 - brady: just add ears to the gerrymander head and that should work fine
2017-08-21 01:03:02.257000 - brady: 
2017-08-21 01:03:00.448000 - brady: use this texture
2017-08-21 01:02:15.152000 - brady: 
2017-08-21 01:02:00.875000 - brady: <@187604337076338688> hey can i get you started on making a new code monkey/ software simian head model
2017-08-20 20:22:42.481000 - qloo: cio is on the right
2017-08-20 20:22:35.813000 - qloo: the cogs is in the left
2017-08-20 16:57:52.897000 - Kyle: We need a spot for "The CIO" and probably another for "COGS"
2017-08-20 16:51:24.352000 - qloo: hmm
2017-08-20 16:51:19.555000 - qloo: ah yea
2017-08-20 16:45:56.387000 - Jake S.: I think it looks better without the gears <@!190864079634694144>
2017-08-20 15:59:17.379000 - qloo: oof
2017-08-20 15:59:09.926000 - qloo: 
2017-08-20 02:18:29.631000 - brady: ok
2017-08-20 02:13:33.396000 - Spencer: 
2017-08-20 02:11:46.497000 - Spencer: but the trashcan would probably need a texture similar to whats on the left of this texture
2017-08-20 02:11:28.044000 - Spencer: <@191661929905913856> I know you dont have a lot of time recently
2017-08-19 23:19:44.029000 - Spencer: brady or whomever else can edit it afterward
2017-08-19 23:18:12.968000 - Spencer: I'll probably texture it myself
2017-08-19 23:18:02.725000 - Spencer: couldnt agree more
2017-08-19 23:14:53.395000 - AbsentHiya: smh
2017-08-19 23:14:47.932000 - Spencer: oof
2017-08-19 23:14:46.691000 - Spencer: remodeling this entire trashcan (again)
2017-08-19 23:14:38.219000 - Spencer: actually studied the models more
2017-08-19 22:24:59.786000 - AbsentHiya: ok
2017-08-19 22:24:56.206000 - Spencer: so ill drop that
2017-08-19 22:24:52.889000 - Spencer: and they dont have rounding near the opening of the trash cans
2017-08-19 22:24:40.412000 - Spencer: looking at the other props disney made
2017-08-19 22:17:48.182000 - qloo: i also gotta work on adding labels to the CIO + skipper cards
2017-08-19 22:17:36.131000 - qloo: yeaa
2017-08-19 22:17:33.411000 - brady: doesnt make sense
2017-08-19 22:17:30.168000 - brady: idk if we are doing that
2017-08-19 22:16:08.680000 - qloo: not sure how to approach it though, since i haven't seen any playground cards from tto
2017-08-19 22:15:40.357000 - qloo: ok, so we need a trading card for Forests End, right?
2017-08-19 22:13:36.701000 - AbsentHiya: just round all 4 of the sides of the face
2017-08-19 22:13:22.270000 - AbsentHiya: ok then nvm forget i said anything lmao
2017-08-19 22:12:38.966000 - Spencer: kind of
2017-08-19 22:09:17.055000 - AbsentHiya: pretty much
2017-08-19 22:09:15.367000 - AbsentHiya: would it look like that
2017-08-19 22:09:12.407000 - AbsentHiya: if you took the lid off and looked from above
2017-08-19 22:09:04.332000 - AbsentHiya: https://gyazo.com/745af054b278b1f0b8a3d723ba0868c7
2017-08-19 22:08:57.052000 - Spencer: the inside will look like this
2017-08-19 22:08:52.642000 - Spencer: 
2017-08-19 22:07:00.841000 - AbsentHiya: 1 sec
2017-08-19 22:06:57.310000 - AbsentHiya: the inside of the trash can looks like
2017-08-19 22:05:50.400000 - Spencer: its just the shader
2017-08-19 22:05:45.437000 - Spencer: no
2017-08-19 22:04:50.307000 - AbsentHiya: is this rounded
2017-08-19 22:04:48.110000 - AbsentHiya: https://gyazo.com/f78f6403a0c4ba40e076b453f8876b16
2017-08-19 22:04:16.941000 - Spencer: like 3 more polys
2017-08-19 22:04:11.344000 - Spencer: and as for the interior its not as rounded as it looks, its just a bevel with a single division
2017-08-19 22:02:54.956000 - Spencer: k
2017-08-19 22:02:39.906000 - AbsentHiya: maybe hollow it out completely but make it dark on the inside so u can barely see it's hollow
2017-08-19 22:02:25.397000 - AbsentHiya: less rounding on the interior
2017-08-19 22:02:19.418000 - Spencer: lemme know
2017-08-19 22:02:17.983000 - Spencer: any adjustments you might want uhhhh
2017-08-19 22:02:06.007000 - Spencer: 
2017-08-19 22:01:26.207000 - Spencer: but I guess that's where textures come in
2017-08-19 22:01:18.011000 - Spencer: I wanted to make the trash can a little more personalized to FE
2017-08-19 21:59:16.493000 - Spencer: 
2017-08-18 19:33:15.585000 - qloo: thanks!
2017-08-18 19:33:10.152000 - Rare: ur good <@!190864079634694144>
2017-08-15 19:15:25.228000 - qloo: thank u!!
2017-08-15 19:05:41.096000 - Kyle: bebopüëå
2017-08-15 18:31:55.509000 - Disyer: <@!190864079634694144> dude thats so cool
2017-08-15 17:58:05.083000 - Kyle: Nice
2017-08-15 17:39:52.371000 - qloo: oof
2017-08-14 22:11:42.473000 - AbsentHiya: probably
2017-08-14 22:11:40.120000 - AbsentHiya: I'll have to look over it
2017-08-13 19:48:44.220000 - Frank: <@211862557726605313> do you think I should go back and make street one a bit smaller?
2017-08-13 17:20:21.178000 - brady: ok
2017-08-13 17:12:11.590000 - Jake S.: <@191661929905913856> theres nothing wrong with being differentttt
2017-08-13 17:10:06.926000 - Kyle: They were all over the place
2017-08-13 17:09:57.926000 - Kyle: I mean, the original TTO trading cards didn't have a concrete style
2017-08-13 17:06:44.116000 - brady: and the farther we get in SOME cases is good but the artstyle is something that we shouldnt really change
2017-08-13 17:06:08.070000 - brady: but i feel like we should at least stay similar to their artstyle
2017-08-13 17:01:54.388000 - Kyle: The farther we get from TTR and TTO, the better
2017-08-13 17:01:36.696000 - Kyle: I think we should keep this artstyle
2017-08-13 16:51:33.744000 - qloo: yeaa
2017-08-13 16:51:29.173000 - brady: just compared to the style of the ttr cards and the tto cards this would be more different
2017-08-13 16:50:57.780000 - brady: im not saying its bad
2017-08-13 16:50:53.121000 - brady: my only concern is if thats the style we should use for the cards
2017-08-13 16:44:24.534000 - qloo: thank you!!!
2017-08-13 16:42:35.516000 - Kyle: 10/10 as always
