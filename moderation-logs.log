2017-09-08 08:33:25.401000 - SlimShadyIAm: Idk if we ever showed you new-ish people this but this exists https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QJjwSjap-jTCQd8JzYaUTh65fk_wDg_wnWU6Ms4HENM/edit#heading=h.9b5aidbpw1i3
2017-09-08 03:17:10.189000 - Kyle: This was deliberate & targeted people repeatedly
2017-09-08 03:16:49.977000 - Kyle: Plus, it's obvious that this wasn't just "A little mistake" or "He just got carried away a bit"
2017-09-08 03:16:15.821000 - Kyle: Yes exactly
2017-09-08 02:12:06.921000 - Triangle (Andrew) Vance: <@192739415360012289> it works like this.. 
Once action is taken (three day ban), it's assumed that they won't do it again
2017-09-07 23:38:02.291000 - Kyle: "Come to O:DS guys, you can sexually harass someone 4 times before you get permabanned"
2017-09-07 23:36:42.656000 - Kyle: If he continues again it'll be a perma
2017-09-07 23:36:31.483000 - Kyle: That's way too lax
2017-09-07 19:53:34.738000 - AbsentHiya: after that perma
2017-09-07 19:53:27.504000 - AbsentHiya: if he continues again, a month
2017-09-07 19:53:22.617000 - AbsentHiya: if he continues, a week
2017-09-07 19:53:12.828000 - AbsentHiya: <@192739415360012289> 3 days is good
2017-09-07 04:21:56.889000 - Kyle: Going to give him a 3-day ban until I can get some more advice on this.
2017-09-07 04:19:40.580000 - Kyle: (This is being done to a kid who I know for a fact is 8, Timarant)
2017-09-07 04:19:23.859000 - Kyle: 
2017-09-07 04:18:03.813000 - Kyle: 
2017-09-07 04:17:40.240000 - Kyle: 
2017-09-07 04:17:36.180000 - Kyle: So I found a guy who has been sexually harassing and threatening to hack other players & take down the O:DS server. He's been doing this for 3 months. I remember dealing with him with *Cherry* still as my friend. I want to permaban him, but you guys don't seem to like me making examples out of deliberate hate & harassment, so what do you think?
2017-09-05 08:35:43.615000 - AbsentHiya: the guy will be unbanned in about 56 hours or so
2017-09-05 08:35:19.063000 - AbsentHiya: kek
2017-09-05 08:04:36.549000 - SlimShadyIAm: aside from any permanent bans, i would think that's the longest ban ever handed out on ods <@192739415360012289>
2017-09-04 19:48:06.581000 - AbsentHiya: yes
2017-09-04 19:39:19.272000 - Kyle: It was justified, did you read the chat logs???
2017-09-04 18:13:43.356000 - AbsentHiya: unless its justified
2017-09-04 18:13:38.100000 - AbsentHiya: we dont fucking ban people for *two weeks*
2017-09-04 18:13:33.238000 - AbsentHiya: kyle
2017-09-04 18:13:14.249000 - Kyle: He's either a troll or a kid with 0 self control
2017-09-04 18:12:46.314000 - Kyle: Go read his chat logs first
2017-09-04 08:41:21.161000 - AbsentHiya: I'm adjusting the ban when I get on my pc
2017-09-04 08:37:18.807000 - SlimShadyIAm: 2 weeks is fucking insane...
2017-09-04 08:16:45.733000 - AbsentHiya: <@192739415360012289> you should have only done 3 days to a week for that mate
2017-09-04 05:17:25.594000 - Kyle: 2 weeks was *gentle*
2017-09-04 05:17:14.349000 - Kyle: Also harassed and attempted to green a guy who didn't friend him
2017-09-04 05:16:35.748000 - Kyle: He was calling basically everyone he saw an asshole
2017-09-04 05:05:16.367000 - SlimShadyIAm: U cray
