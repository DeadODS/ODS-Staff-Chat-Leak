2017-09-03 07:29:36.363000 - brady: Hey @everyone  I am going to be leaving the team today. Not because I am not enjoying my time working on this game, but because I need to focus on school and this ambitious project is interfering with that. I will work on the things I have already such as the new map and the new Gagshop sign and such, but please do not come to me for any art. You may confront me for my opinion on anything. I am sorry that this is very sudden, but after studying for a test and getting 20% less than someone who didn't study pressures me into making this choice. Over winter and summer, I will have more free time and by then you can inquire me about any work that needs to be done. Thanks. -Brady
